<br /><span class="h2line2">OLD STONY</span></h2>
<p>The road wound through spike pines which stood
silhouetted in the fading daylight.</p>
<p>Long, empty miles lay behind the weary travelers
since they had left Philmont Boy Scout Ranch in
the New Mexico Rockies. More miles stretched endlessly
ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, when do we stop for grub? This air sure
gives a guy a whale of an appetite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;War&rdquo; Washburn, a skinny, freckled youngster,
rode with feet dangling out the car window. His
question was shot at their driver, Hap Livingston,
leader of Boy Scout Explorer Post 21 of Belton
City.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston and the four explorers were returning
to their home state after twelve days of
rugged fun at the Boy Scout ranch. They had hoped
to reach the Colorado border by nightfall, but now
that seemed impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; piped up tow-headed Willie Medaugh.
&ldquo;What say we start looking for a camp site? It&rsquo;s
going to get dark early tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The fifteen-year-old sat wedged in the back seat
of the sedan between Jack Hartwell and Ken Dougherty,
the two more serious members of the husky
Scout crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had
a hard drive, and I&rsquo;m ready to hit the sack&mdash;since
you insist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already Jack was consulting the road map. &ldquo;Nearest
town is Rocking Horse, eight miles ahead,&rdquo; he
reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stop there,&rdquo; the Scout leader decided. &ldquo;If
we can find a camp site with all the comforts of
home, I&rsquo;m for taking it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Hap!&rdquo; Ken drawled. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t stand the gaff
any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was asked in jest. As the four explorers
knew well, their leader, a former FBI man,
could stand up under grueling physical punishment.
This he had proven during recent adventure trips to
Peru and Emerald Valley in Colombia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sort of lazy tonight,&rdquo; Hap confessed. &ldquo;Riding
herd over War at Philmont must have worn
me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dragging him away from the ranch was the
hardest,&rdquo; Jack recalled, his blue eyes twinkling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there was so much to do,&rdquo; War defended
himself. &ldquo;I wanted to make another pack trip on
the trail Kit Carson once rode. And I wanted to
visit the old mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From his shirt pocket he pulled out a handkerchief
in which were wrapped several bits of sparkling
rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still hoarding that junk?&rdquo; Ken asked with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Junk! Just see it shine in the sunlight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken pretended to cover his eyes. &ldquo;The glow blinds
me!&rdquo; he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s genuine gold,&rdquo; War said indignantly.
&ldquo;I panned it at Philmont.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we know,&rdquo; drawled Willie. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told us
at least twenty times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That rare specimen of yours should assay about
1/800ths of a cent to the ton!&rdquo; Jack teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, it was fun panning it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything at Philmont was fun,&rdquo; Jack declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing deer, elk, and bear in natural surroundings.
Learning how to climb and handle an axe.
Instruction in fire building and cooking. But now
it&rsquo;s behind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Rocking Horse is ahead,&rdquo; reminded Mr.
Livingston. &ldquo;Save the arguments, lads. You&rsquo;ll need
your energy for making camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The Scouts took the hint and fell silent. True,
everyone would have enjoyed another two weeks in
the West, but money was dwindling. So, laden with
souvenirs and happy memories, they were now on
the way home.</p>
<p>Presently the dusty car pulled into Rocking Horse.
The city, with a cluster of adobe houses at the outskirts,
appeared to have not more than about eight
thousand residents. After inquiry at a filling station,
Mr. Livingston drove to a motel and camp site at
the city&rsquo;s northern edge.</p>
<p>Few cars were parked near the tiny office on the
roadside. The reason for the comparative desertion
was immediately apparent to the Scouts, for the motel
buildings were run-down and in need of paint. The
pine grove and camp site at the rear did not look
too attractive, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it, boys?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it may not be so bad,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
all tired, so let&rsquo;s hole in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others agreed. Accordingly, Mr. Livingston
drove up close to the office. He and Jack went inside
to register for the group.</p>
<p>An old man who wore a soiled Stetson hat sat
tipped back comfortably in a chair. His big heavy
boots came down from the desk, and he squinted
at them with watery blue eyes which were bright
and sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Mr. Livingston returned the hearty greeting and
inquired about a camp site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;ve got plenty o&rsquo; room for you,&rdquo; the old
man replied. He dug into the old-fashioned roll-top
desk for a registry book. &ldquo;How many in your party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five. We won&rsquo;t need a cabin&mdash;only space for our
two tents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll cost you two bucks for the night.&rdquo; The
old man thrust a pen at the Scout leader. All the
while, he was studying Jack&rsquo;s green uniform with
the &ldquo;BSA&rdquo; strip over the right shirt pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here in Rocking Horse we don&rsquo;t ask a man
where&rsquo;s he going, or where he&rsquo;s been,&rdquo; he drawled.
&ldquo;But danged if I&rsquo;m not curious about that BSA on
your pocket. Reckon it means Better Stay Away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stands for Boy Scouts of America,&rdquo; Jack explained.
&ldquo;Are you the motel owner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me.&rdquo; The old man stretched out a calloused
hand to take the two dollar bills Mr. Livingston
offered. &ldquo;These diggin&rsquo;s are owned by a hard-fisted
hombre by the name o&rsquo; Jarrett Walz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like him?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked, mildly
amused at the old-timer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t say so, did I? Walz gives me my grub
and a cabin for lookin&rsquo; after this place. When you&rsquo;re
pushing eighty and have a bad ticker, you&rsquo;re not too
particular.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Jack and Mr. Livingston regarded the old man
with new interest and respect. Despite shaggy white
hair and a weather-beaten face, he did not look more
than seventy, for his muscles were firm and his
stooping shoulders were powerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Stony,&rdquo; the old man volunteered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show you where to park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shuffling out of the office, he directed them to
the rear of the deep lot.</p>
<p>Old Stony loitered to watch as the Scouts efficiently
set about unloading equipment and setting
up their tents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nested cooking pans and sleeping bags!&rdquo; he
cackled. &ldquo;In my day, we used a lard pail and our
own backs for a mattress. Anything you&rsquo;ll be
wanting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, thank you,&rdquo; Jack assured him.</p>
<p>Old Stony started to leave. Then he halted, hesitated,
and said: &ldquo;See that little cabin yonder? That&rsquo;s
where I flop. It gets kind o&rsquo; lonesome sittin&rsquo; there
alone at night, so if you boys have nothing to do
later on, drop by and we can chin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; Jack agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you could spin some real tales of the Old
West,&rdquo; War interposed eagerly. &ldquo;Were you a cow-puncher?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t catch me herding beef,&rdquo; Old Stony
said in disgust. &ldquo;I was a prospector. If it hadn&rsquo;t been
for a bad run o&rsquo; luck, I&rsquo;d own this joint instead o&rsquo;
taking orders from Walz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You nearly struck it rich?&rdquo; War prodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dang it!&rdquo; Old Stony snorted. &ldquo;I hit gold&mdash;enough
to put me on Easy Street for the rest o&rsquo; my days.
Only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A melancholy, dreamy look crept over the old
fellow&rsquo;s leathery face, and his gaze became fixed
upon the faraway mountains. For a long moment
he seemed lost in the memory of a colorful past.
Then, with a shake of his head, he broke up his
reverie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll tell you about it tonight,&rdquo; he hinted.
&ldquo;Then again, maybe I won&rsquo;t. Anyway, drop around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Old Stony had gone, the Explorers got a fire
started and made supper. Over the bacon and eggs,
they discussed him and his invitation to drop around
later at his cabin. Willie was sure it would be a waste
of time, but the other Explorers wanted to go,
especially War.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old boy will tell us about his prospecting
days if we prime him right,&rdquo; he insisted, stirring the
camp fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, he&rsquo;ll spin a wild tale of finding gold,&rdquo; jeered
Willie, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll fall for it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Meeting Old Stony had made the Scouts forget
their weariness. They thought it would be interesting
to chat with the aged camp worker. Accordingly,
after the supper dishes were put away, War,
Ken, and Jack went over to his cabin. It was
a mild August night, and the cabin door stood
open.</p>
<p>At Jack&rsquo;s knock, the prospector&rsquo;s deep voice
boomed: &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interior of the one-room cabin was cheerless
except for a small fire in the grate. It was furnished
with a makeshift bed, a cracked mirror, a chest of
drawers, and an old rocker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; Old Stony invited, waving them to a
seat on the sagging bed.</p>
<p>The boys could not fail to respond to the old
fellow&rsquo;s warmth and hospitality. Sensing his loneliness,
they told him of their stay at the Scout ranch
and then launched into an account of their previous
exciting trips to Peru and Colombia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not like the regular run o&rsquo; tourists that
come through here,&rdquo; Old Stony said, lighting his
pipe. &ldquo;Right off, when I saw you make camp I knew
you weren&rsquo;t softies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you lived in Rocking Horse?&rdquo; War
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too long. But I reckon I&rsquo;m stuck here until I
hit the Long Trail. When I head for that last roundup&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s not so far off now&mdash;I reckon my secret
will die with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your secret?&rdquo; Ken repeated, sensing that the old
man was ready to launch into his tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup. There are men who would give their lives
to know what I got locked here.&rdquo; Old Stony tapped
his hairy chest. &ldquo;Jarrett Walz in particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>War leaned forward on the bed. &ldquo;A secret about
gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Stony hitched his rocker nearer the fire. Without
looking at the Explorers, he began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back in the early 1900&rsquo;s my podner and I made
our lucky strike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here in New Mexico?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, in Colorado. My podner and I were lured
West by the Shining Mountains&mdash;the Rockies, folks
call &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But weren&rsquo;t the big Colorado gold strikes earlier
than 1900?&rdquo; Ken interposed thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read
about Leadville and Cripple Creek in 1891&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interruption annoyed Old Stony. &ldquo;This place
I&rsquo;m telling you about you&rsquo;ve never read of,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and you never will because it&rsquo;s a place hard to reach
even today. My podner and I gave it the name of
Headless Hollow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a way in if you know the trail and can
stand hardships. There&rsquo;s no way out except the way
in. It&rsquo;s in an out-of-the way valley, rimmed by canyons,
hard by a little lake no bigger&rsquo;n a tin cup. To
get there you back-pack over miles o&rsquo; rock so steep
it makes me dizzy to think of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you found gold?&rdquo; prompted War.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, we found it, and a heap o&rsquo; trouble. Here, let
me show you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abruptly Old Stony dug a polished nugget from
his pants pocket. Even in the poor lamplight, the
color of gold was there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; War exclaimed, breathing heavily. &ldquo;That
makes my sample look like peanuts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This nugget came from Headless Hollow?&rdquo; Jack
asked, relishing the old man&rsquo;s tale.</p>
<p>Stony sucked at his pipe as he carefully replaced
the metal in his wrinkled overalls.</p>
<p>Without answering, he resumed: &ldquo;I was a young
fellow in those days, strong as an ox. If it wasn&rsquo;t for
my bad heart and some other things, I&rsquo;d go back
there now and make my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is this valley of gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you, son. But there are men who
would pay me well to know my secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you found gold,&rdquo; Jack asked, &ldquo;why did you
leave the valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me that question, son. My past is my
own and, God willing, it will die with me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The old man turned suddenly in his rocking chair.</p>
<p>Unnoticed by the Explorers, a tall man in his
thirties, with a rock-like, expressionless face, had
come to the open doorway. Ignoring the Scouts, he
spoke directly to Stony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crawl out, you lazy old buzzard! The man in No.
4 wants fresh towels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stony got heavily from his chair. He made no
answer, but the sparkle of life had vanished from
his ruddy face.</p>
<p>Ill at ease, the Explorers started to leave. As if
by design, the motel owner walked with them a
short distance toward their camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Stony spinning wild yarns again?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was telling us about striking gold when he
was a young man,&rdquo; War volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he let you into the secret of where
his precious map is hidden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; Jack spoke up. &ldquo;Does he have a map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jarrett Walz gave a snort. &ldquo;That old goat is all
talk. Everything he has, even the clothes on his
back, comes from me. In exchange he gives me laziness
and lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old fool says I am after his gold. I figure he
was giving you a line of chatter when I came up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t under discussion,&rdquo; Jack said dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he tell you about his wonderful valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leaving tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, then.&rdquo; The motel owner seemed
suddenly relieved. &ldquo;If Old Stony bothers you again,
call me. Good night now, and good rest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 2</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TROUBLE IN CAMP</span></h2>
<p>Cold night air seeped through the tent walls. Jack
Hartwell stirred restlessly in his sleeping bag and
sat up. What had awakened him? Beside him, Ken
and Willie were dead to the world. All was quiet.</p>
<p>Annoyed at himself, Jack got up and opened the
tent flap. A few stars were winking, but otherwise
it was a dark night. It might be two A.M. or thereabouts,
he judged. There was no sign of anyone
around the camp, yet distinctly he sensed that something
was wrong.</p>
<p>It was not the first time Jack&rsquo;s instincts had acted
as an alarm clock. The high school senior and Explorer
crew leader was gifted with high intelligence
and a certain intuition which had repeatedly saved
him or his friends from near disaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Jack had proven himself the most valuable of the
Explorers during the exciting adventure trips to
South America which have been described in <i>The
Boy Scout Explorers at Treasure Mountain</i>, and <i>The
Boy Scout Explorers at Emerald Valley</i>. On this
particular occasion, only the four tried-and-true Explorers
had made the trip to Philmont Scout Ranch
at Cimarron, New Mexico. In Belton City, however,
they were associated with a large and active
troop.</p>
<p>As Jack stood shivering in the chill night air, his
ears picked up a disturbing sound. The noise, a
series of thuds, and a groan, seemed to come from
the direction of Old Stony&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>Jack did not hesitate. Diving back into the tent,
he reached for trousers and shoes. By this time, Ken
was awake and drowsily asked what was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s doing at Stony&rsquo;s cabin,&rdquo; Jack told
him tersely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken came fully awake in a flash. Asking no further
questions, he too began to dress hurriedly.
Willie slumbered peacefully on.</p>
<p>Once dressed, Jack and Ken started at a fast trot
toward the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you think anything&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Ken
demanded.</p>
<p>Before Jack could tell him, they both saw a light
flash on and off in the cabin. Then the door opened,
and a man ran out. In the darkness, the two Explorers
gained only a general impression of someone
tall and shadowy. His face was turned away from
them, and he moved fast. They saw him dart past
the unlighted motel office and into an alley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t Old Stony!&rdquo; Ken gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts crossed the driveway and shoved open
the cabin door. Jack found the light switch. As the
room became illuminated, he and Ken both stiffened
in horror.</p>
<p>Old Stony, his bed unmade, was sprawling on the
floor, bleeding from a forehead wound. The aged
man was moaning piteously. For just an instant Ken
and Jack thought he had suffered a stroke and fallen.
But the evidence convinced them otherwise. Even
if they had not seen the fleeing intruder, the condition
of the cabin would have told its graphic
story. Drawers had been overturned. Old Stony&rsquo;s
few pathetic possessions were scattered on the bare
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robbery,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s only comment.</p>
<p>Without attempting to lift the old man from the
floor, they quickly examined his wound. It did not
seem deep. However, the old man was certainly in
a state of shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Hap and our first-aid kit,&rdquo; Jack directed Ken.
&ldquo;Better call a doctor, too. Stony&rsquo;s an old fellow, and
he has a heart condition.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Ken hurried away. Left alone, Jack covered Stony
with a blanket and pillowed his head. He was turning
away to look for something he could use for a
temporary bandage, when the old man&rsquo;s lips began
to move.</p>
<p>Jack bent closer. &ldquo;Who was it that hit you?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the old fellow mumbled. &ldquo;Woke
up&mdash;the skunk was pawing through my things. I
yelled at him, and then he hit me on the skull. Last
I knew for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see his face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Old Stony admitted in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever it was must have meant to rob you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thieving rascal was after my gold and the
map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over Jack&rsquo;s protests, Old Stony raised himself up
on an elbow. His gaze raked the entire cabin from
the fireplace to the bed. What he saw seemed to
satisfy him, for he gave a feeble, throaty chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The skunk didn&rsquo;t get what he was after! Old
Stony is nobody&rsquo;s fool. Young fellow, if you&rsquo;ll help
me, I&rsquo;ll get back into bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; Jack warned him. &ldquo;The
doctor will be here in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor, fiddlesticks! It takes more&rsquo;n a little tap
on the head to knock out Old Stony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because the aged man was not to be denied, Jack
helped him into bed, but he was alarmed at the
prospector&rsquo;s pallor and weakness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; Stony mumbled. &ldquo;Thank you,
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was increasingly clear to Jack that the old man
was not all right, so he was greatly relieved when
Ken came back with Mr. Livingston, Willie, and
War.</p>
<p>One glance at the man on the bed, and the Scout
leader drew Ken aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to be in bad shape,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Go for
a doctor, and tell him to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Ken was carrying out the order, the other
Scouts dressed Stony&rsquo;s wound. He made no further
attempt to talk, but now and then managed to grin
at them in a feeble way.</p>
<p>Jack and Willie made a fast tour of the motel
grounds. However, it did not surprise them that they
found no trace of the man who had so brutally
attacked the cabin dweller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever he is, he&rsquo;ll be a mile from here by
now,&rdquo; Jack remarked as they walked back. &ldquo;No
question about it, theft was the motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man&rsquo;s gold and map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think there is any gold?&rdquo; Willie asked skeptically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Last night I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Jack replied thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m not so sure. Old Stony certainly acted as
if he had something valuable hidden in the cabin,
and apparently it&rsquo;s still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thief was probably frightened away before
he finished his search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either that, or he was scared, Willie. He may
have hit Old Stony harder than he intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back in the cabin the boys found that Jarrett
Walz had come from his nearby home to check on
the activity. Informed by Mr. Livingston as to what
had happened, he made no attempt to hide his
annoyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I suppose Stony will insist on lying in bed
for a week!&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for the doctor to decide,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
rejoined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sent for a doctor?&rdquo; the motel owner fairly
screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m to pay the bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a humanitarian thing to do. Stony
needs a doctor. No question about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time, Mr. Walz seemed concerned
about his worker&rsquo;s condition. He went over to the
bed, peering intently at the colorless face. After a
moment, he turned away and made no further protest
about the doctor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>It was twenty minutes later when Dr. James Alcott
reached the cabin. He checked Stony&rsquo;s heart,
examined the wound, and then told Mr. Walz to call
an ambulance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ambulance?&rdquo; the motel owner repeated. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s bad off? Just from that little tap
on the head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a hard blow,&rdquo; the doctor corrected him.
&ldquo;At the hospital we&rsquo;ll take X-rays to see if there is
a skull fracture. I rather doubt it, but in any case
this man needs careful attention. How old is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty-two,&rdquo; Walz said. &ldquo;At least, that&rsquo;s what he
claims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a serious heart condition. At his age, a
shock such as this could be very hard on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc, you don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll die?&rdquo; Walz gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His good physique is in his favor. I&rsquo;d suggest,
though, that you lose no time getting in touch with
relatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relatives? He has none that I ever heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motel owner was plainly worried. Nervously,
he paced back and forth in the cabin, not offering to
help when Jack and Ken gathered together the few
things which Stony would need at the hospital.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>It was 3:30 A.M. by War&rsquo;s watch when an ambulance
pulled into the parking lot. Two attendants
with a stretcher efficiently transferred Stony from his
bed to their vehicle. Jarrett Walz did not offer to
ride in the ambulance. Unwilling to see the old man
taken without anyone to sit by him, Jack and Ken
climbed in. Mr. Livingston, War, and Willie followed
the ambulance in their own car.</p>
<p>At the hospital, matters were taken from the
Scouts&rsquo; hands. Old Stony was passed through emergency
and given a ward bed. Meanwhile, Mr.
Livingston signed papers at the hospital office and
provided what little information he could about the
attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walz should have come along,&rdquo; the Scout leader
remarked to Jack. &ldquo;I figure he stayed away for fear
he&rsquo;d be hooked on the bill. How is Stony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No report yet,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;But when I looked
in on him a minute ago, he was resting comfortably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell you anything more about his attacker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stony didn&rsquo;t say a word. In fact, he hardly
recognized me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a shake of his head, Mr. Livingston indicated
that the information was disturbing. After a
moment, he said: &ldquo;Well, round up Warwick, Willie,
and Ken. We&rsquo;ve done everything we can for the
poor old fellow. May as well get back to camp and
try to catch a few winks before dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In sober silence the Scouts drove back to the
motel. A light was on&mdash;in the front office, but Mr.
Walz was not there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a light in Stony&rsquo;s cabin, too,&rdquo; Jack noted
as the car turned into the driveway. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny!
I distinctly recall turning it off after everyone left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, you did!&rdquo; Ken exclaimed.</p>
<p>No one spoke for a moment as the same thought
occurred to all: Stony&rsquo;s mysterious attacker might
have returned!</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston stopped the car and switched off
the ignition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; he said grimly, heading for the
cabin. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out about this!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 3</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TREASURE MAP</span></h2>
<p>At the doorway of Old Stony&rsquo;s cabin, Mr. Livingston
and the Scouts halted. Inside, crouching on
the floor, a man was riffling through a box of papers,
evidently pulled from beneath the bed.</p>
<p>It was Jarrett Walz.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston coughed. At once the motel owner
whirled around. Caught by surprise, he lost his
balance and collapsed awkwardly on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, back already?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t expect to find you here,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said pointedly.</p>
<p>Mr. Walz got to his feet. He shoved the box of
papers back under the bed and said, &ldquo;I was just
looking through some of poor Old Stony&rsquo;s junk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we noticed,&rdquo; the Scout leader answered dryly.
&ldquo;Find what you were after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walz gave him a quick, suspicious look. He said
evenly, &ldquo;I was trying to find the names of any relatives
Old Stony may have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single clue?&rdquo; Jack interposed dubiously.
&ldquo;Old Stony must have had a few friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one&mdash;unless maybe you could say he kept up
a writing acquaintance with Craig Warner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motel owner shrugged. &ldquo;Someone he wrote
to in Colorado. A casual acquaintance, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stony didn&rsquo;t seem the type to bother with trivial
friendships,&rdquo; Jack commented. &ldquo;Did he come from
Colorado?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stony must have told you that much himself,&rdquo;
Walz retorted, making no attempt to hide his growing
distaste for the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mean to be inquisitive,&rdquo; interposed Mr.
Livingston smoothly. &ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s rather important
to know something of Stony&rsquo;s past. What was
his last name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? When he came here, he told me his
name was John Stone. That&rsquo;s how he got his nickname,
Old Stony. Later, he said his name was
Adams. And once he told me it was Pickering. So
take your choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have had something to hide.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Old Stony ran away from a past. I suspected
that when I hired him.&rdquo; Walz laughed without
mirth. &ldquo;He was afraid to set foot over the Colorado
line, so I figured he was wanted for something in
that state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kept it a secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Stony never told me anything. Nothing, that
is, except wild yarns. The truth is, he disliked me
and was ungrateful for all I did to help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s in a bad spot at the moment,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston said. &ldquo;Any idea who might have attacked
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The motive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I figure some hoodlum put faith in Stony&rsquo;s
story of having gold or a map to a gold mine. Trouble
with him, he couldn&rsquo;t keep his lips from wagging.
He invited the attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve reported it to the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walz frowned. &ldquo;Why, no. Figured it was none of
their business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s customary, isn&rsquo;t it, to report an assault and
an attempted theft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in Rocking Horse it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Walz said shortly.
&ldquo;A police investigation here wouldn&rsquo;t mean a thing.
Far as I&rsquo;m concerned, Stony will have to do the
reporting, if any is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may not be possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll snap out of it,&rdquo; Walz said carelessly.
&ldquo;That old boy has a constitution like iron.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re right. Just what can you tell us
about Stony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walz edged toward the door. Plainly, he wanted
to put an end to the questions. But he replied: &ldquo;I
told you about all I know. He drifted into this town
like a tumbleweed some years ago. I gave him a
job&mdash;his board and room in return for looking after
the cabins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never told you much about himself?&rdquo; Ken
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he talked enough, but always he handed out
lies. The old coot was suspicious by nature. Why,
he became obsessed with the idea I wanted to rob
him of his gold and the map!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did show us a nugget last night,&rdquo; War said.
&ldquo;A big one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it real gold?&rdquo; War asked in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gold, all right. But you can bet Old Stony
never dug it from a mine or washed it from a creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, I wonder what became of that
nugget?&rdquo; Jack asked. &ldquo;Old Stony had it wrapped
in a handkerchief last night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have the nugget.&rdquo; Walz made the admission
half defiantly. &ldquo;Old Stony sets great store by it. I
figured I&rsquo;d better take it before someone went off
with it. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll drop it around to him at the
hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts had their own opinion of the motel
owner&rsquo;s motive in taking the nugget. However, they
could not accuse him.</p>
<p>Jack did say, &ldquo;Find any other nuggets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo; Walz pushed past him, through the
open door. &ldquo;Excuse me, now. I&rsquo;ve had a hard night
and I&rsquo;m turning in.&rdquo; He started away, only to halt.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re leaving today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect to,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have a good trip,&rdquo; Walz said, with a show
of friendliness.</p>
<p>The Scouts waited outside the cabin until the
motel owner was beyond view. Then Willie remarked
that Walz had neglected to lock the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That indicates he&rsquo;s gone through poor Old Stony&rsquo;s
possessions from A to Z,&rdquo; Jack declared. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
satisfied there&rsquo;s nothing of value here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, it would do no harm to look around
ourselves,&rdquo; War proposed. &ldquo;Walz could have missed
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston vetoed the suggestion. &ldquo;No, War.
This is Stony&rsquo;s cabin. It ought to be locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all get to bed,&rdquo; Willie urged. &ldquo;Look at the
horizon. It&rsquo;s nearly dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>After a bit of debate, the Scouts decided to try
to catch an hour of sleep before breaking camp.
Accordingly, forgetting the unlocked cabin door,
they retired to their tents. Everyone slept soundly.</p>
<p>When Jack finally opened his eyes, a hot sun
was beating down on the canvas. He was alone in
the tent. Peering out, he sniffed the aroma of frying
eggs. The others were up ahead of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, am I lazy!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What time is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten to nine,&rdquo; Willie told him as he turned the
eggs. &ldquo;You were sleeping like a babe, so we didn&rsquo;t
call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack quickly dressed and helped Mr. Livingston
strike and pack the two tents. By that time Willie
had breakfast ready to serve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re making a late start,&rdquo; the Scout leader said,
looking ruefully at his watch. &ldquo;But we all needed
sleep. Last night was rough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder how Old Stony is getting along?&rdquo; Jack
speculated. &ldquo;Any word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went up to the office to inquire,&rdquo; Ken replied.
&ldquo;The place was locked up. No sign of Walz. He&rsquo;s
probably still in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sort of hate to pull out of here without knowing
Stony&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we all do,&rdquo; Ken agreed soberly. &ldquo;After
we&rsquo;re packed and ready to hit the road, what say
we stop somewhere to telephone the hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston approved. &ldquo;I was
going to suggest it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short order the Scouts finished breakfast, disposed
of the garbage, and put out their fire. Soon
the car was packed ready for their departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re leaving the camp cleaner than we
found it,&rdquo; Ken said, making a last careful survey
before they pulled out.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston turned the car around on the lot
and started to drive past the office. Before he could
do so, a man came across the street from a drugstore
and signaled for the car to stop.</p>
<p>As Mr. Livingston pulled up, the stranger said:
&ldquo;The hospital just called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Stony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the motel office seems to be closed. So they
called my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taken a turn for the worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told Walz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man from the drugstore shook his head. &ldquo;Old
Stony doesn&rsquo;t want to see Walz. It&rsquo;s you folks he&rsquo;s
asking for. If you can, go right away, or it may be
too late.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 4</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A BAG OF BEANS</span></h2>
<p>In the corridor of Memorial Hospital, Doctor Alcott
confirmed the information the Scouts had been
given&mdash;Old Stony had suffered a heart attack and
was not expected to live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he still conscious?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and his mind remains alert. He has been asking
repeatedly for the Scouts. That&rsquo;s why we sent
for you. Sorry to bother you, but it seems to mean a
lot to the old man. Something appears to be on his
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you did call,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston replied.
&ldquo;May we go in now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it would be better if only two of you see
him, and don&rsquo;t stay long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, while the others waited in the downstairs
lobby, Hap and Jack followed a nurse into the
ward. A screen had been set up at Old Stony&rsquo;s bed
to provide a measure of privacy.</p>
<p>As Mr. Livingston and Jack paused beside him,
the old fellow opened his eyes and managed to grin
feebly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;How are you feeling?&rdquo; Jack asked, because he
could think of nothing else to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so hot,&rdquo; Old Stony returned. His bloodless
fingers plucked at the sheet. &ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;m about
ready to mount my pale white horse and ride to the
last roundup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston tried to reassure him.
&ldquo;In a few days you&rsquo;ll snap out of this. There&rsquo;s fighting
spirit in you, Stony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s fight, but the old ticker&rsquo;s getting
mighty tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stony closed his eyes and for several minutes
seemed almost to forget his visitors. They were debating
whether or not to slip away quietly, when
he aroused himself again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull up your chairs and listen close,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to tell you something important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you feel strong enough to talk?&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston inquired doubtfully, as he and Jack
brought their chairs to the bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks! If it takes my last breath, I have
to get this off my chest. Now, listen close, because
I&rsquo;m winding up to tell you the true story o&rsquo; why I
never went back to Colorado to live on my hard-earned
gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Jack and Hap exchanged a quick glance. Would
the old man tell them another wild tale, they wondered?
Or would this story, in all probability his
last, be a true one?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be wasting time trying to find any of my
family after I&rsquo;ve kicked off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no relatives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a chick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about your friend in Colorado?&rdquo; Jack suggested.
&ldquo;I think Jarrett Walz said his name was
Craig Warner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Stony rolled his head on the pillow. &ldquo;That
snooping rascal!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been in my
things since they carted me off here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he has,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston admitted.
Fearful of agitating the old man, he did not tell him
the extent to which the motel owner had gone
through his personal papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig Warner isn&rsquo;t exactly my friend,&rdquo; Old Stony
said slowly. &ldquo;Reckon he&rsquo;d hate me if he knew the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You write to him sometimes?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now and then I scratch him a line. I&rsquo;m not much
on writing, and he isn&rsquo;t much on answering. Haven&rsquo;t
heard from him in more&rsquo;n three years now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s not a friend, why write?&rdquo; Jack asked,
puzzled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because of my past. Craig doesn&rsquo;t know this&mdash;he
thinks I&rsquo;m Hank Stone, a screwball prospector.
That&rsquo;s the way I want it. But the reason I kept in
touch all these years is because he&rsquo;s the only son
o&rsquo; my old podner, John Warner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effort of talking had tired Old Stony. He
lay a while with eyes closed and then continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one to deal from the bottom of a deck.
I&rsquo;m honest, I am. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve never trusted
Jarrett Walz. Maybe I&rsquo;m being unfair. He gave me
a job, and for that I&rsquo;m grateful. But I&rsquo;d never trust
him with my secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the gold?&rdquo; Jack prodded.</p>
<p>Old Stony nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start at the beginning,&rdquo;
he went on. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas back in the early 1900&rsquo;s. I don&rsquo;t
exactly recollect the date. My podner, John Warner,
and I got ourselves enough grub to last three months.
Then we hit for the valley we later named Headless
Hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was it?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked. &ldquo;West of
Denver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s hard by a mountain where even to this
day gold has never been struck&mdash;at least, word of
it hasn&rsquo;t hit the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the old gold fields are known&mdash;&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston started to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>The old man broke in: &ldquo;Headless Valley is hard
to get at. The vein my podner and I found is rich,
but it isn&rsquo;t extensive enough to make it worth while
hauling in expensive mining equipment. So I reckon
engineers have given it the go-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you and your partner really found gold
there?&rdquo; Jack asked, rather impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure did. And then our troubles began. All
that summer we worked till our hands were blistered.
We stacked the ore in two caches&mdash;one big
and one little. Our food began to run low. We knew
we had to get out fast before winter set in, but the
gold held us. And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Stony shuddered and seemed unable to go on.
But with an effort, he forced himself to resume:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as we knew, there weren&rsquo;t any human
beings within forty miles of Headless Valley. We
never set eyes on a soul all that summer. But one
morning my podner showed up missing. I found him
by the diggings, dead with a bullet hole through
the back of his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; Jack asked, becoming more
engrossed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I buried him not far from the little cabin we had
built. Marked the grave with his name too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who killed John Warner?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;All these years I&rsquo;ve been asking myself that same
question. Indians, I reckon. Maybe Headless Hollow
was sacred ground to &rsquo;em, and they didn&rsquo;t like us
messing around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The killing wasn&rsquo;t because of the gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon not,&rdquo; Old Stony replied to the Scout
leader&rsquo;s inquiry. &ldquo;Nary a nugget was touched. I&rsquo;m
telling you, after poor John got his, I was plumb
scared. I couldn&rsquo;t see anybody around, but I could
feel &rsquo;em. Sort o&rsquo; like ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts don&rsquo;t fire shots,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said
dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danged right they don&rsquo;t! I figured I&rsquo;d be next
if I didn&rsquo;t light out o&rsquo; there. I took a few of the
nuggets that I could carry in a bag and hit the trail.
Doggone near froze to death before I finally got
back to the nearest town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You left the hidden gold?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, and I reckon it&rsquo;s still there today. At least,
I don&rsquo;t think those caches would ever be found,
unless by somebody who was watching us, or by
Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go back later?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
asked.</p>
<p>Old Stony heaved a heavy sigh. &ldquo;Figured you&rsquo;d
ask me that one. Reckon I&rsquo;ve got to answer true.
When I got back&mdash;well, folks began whispering that
I was the one that did for poor old John. They
said I shot him so I could have the claim all to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t other prospectors try to find Headless
Hollow?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked thoughtfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
inconceivable that your arrival with gold wouldn&rsquo;t
set off a mad scramble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fooled &rsquo;em. Told &rsquo;em a mess of lies that led &rsquo;em
packing in the wrong direction.&rdquo; Old Stony grinned
at the recollection. &ldquo;They sure were burned up! So
to even the score, they got out a warrant charging
me with poor John&rsquo;s murder. That was when I lit
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You left Colorado?&rdquo; Jack prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure did. First I went to California and lost my
grubstake there. Then I drifted back to Arizona,
then on here to New Mexico. Always figured some
day I&rsquo;d go back to Headless Hollow. But the years
came on too fast, and before I knew it, I was an
old man and my last chance was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time, Jack and Mr. Livingston were convinced
that Stony&rsquo;s story was at least half truth. As
for his gold, they were of the opinion that the one
hoarded nugget that Walz had must have represented
his entire fortune.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Therefore, it came as a surprise when the old man
went on: &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m coming to the kernel o&rsquo; the nut.
I reckon I owe poor old John a debt. Half of that
gold I took out of Headless Hollow I figured was his.
I&rsquo;ve kept that half&mdash;never touched it, even when I
didn&rsquo;t know where my next mouthful of meat was
coming from. Now I want that gold to go to John&rsquo;s
son, Craig Warner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Mr. Livingston began to catch the drift
of Stony&rsquo;s thoughts, so they were not too surprised
at his request which came haltingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon it&rsquo;s a lot to ask o&rsquo; strangers&mdash;but I have
no one I can trust. I&rsquo;m asking you&mdash;after I&rsquo;m gone&mdash;will
you get word to Craig Warner? Take him the
map&mdash;the one that shows the true trail to Headless
Hollow and the caches of gold. They&rsquo;re his by rights,
and I want him to have &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is this map?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked, trying
not to show that the strange request troubled him.</p>
<p>Old Stony leaned over to the edge of the bed,
lowering his voice to a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it under the stones&mdash;fireplace&mdash;my
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be glad to look,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston promised.
&ldquo;Where are we to find Craig Warner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His address is in my box of papers&mdash;under the
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lengthy conversation had greatly wearied Old
Stony but, when Jack and Mr. Livingston started
to leave, with a feeble gesture of his hand the prospector
waved them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one thing more,&rdquo; he said, his voice husky.
&ldquo;The gold&mdash;Craig Warner&rsquo;s share&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>A nurse had come to the bedside. With a quick
glance at the patient, she told the two visitors they
had to leave at once.</p>
<p>Old Stony summoned all his failing strength. Gazing
steadily at Jack and Hap, he said clearly: &ldquo;The
bag of pinto beans. The bag of beans. You understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To satisfy the dying old man, the two visitors
nodded. Stony fell back on the pillow, a smile on his
thin lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said my piece,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m
ready for the long trip over the range. God be with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 5</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE SEARCH</span></h2>
<p>The nurse motioned for Jack and Mr. Livingston
to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye, Stony,&rdquo; Jack said, reaching out to grasp
the gnarled hand in a last farewell.</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s lips twitched slightly, but his
closed eyes did not open. Jack and Mr. Livingston
quietly departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll never see the old fellow again,&rdquo;
the Scout leader said with a shake of his head.</p>
<p>Jack asked Hap what he thought of the story the
old prospector had told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Stony seemed
to be telling the truth. It&rsquo;s fantastic&mdash;and yet it&rsquo;s
possible that Headless Hollow may actually exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>War, Willie, and Ken were impatiently waiting
in the hospital lobby. Eagerly, the trio plied Jack
and their leader with questions. With deep interest,
they listened to Hap&rsquo;s report of the talk with Old
Stony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s our move, now?&rdquo; Ken asked. &ldquo;Do we
pull out of Rocking Horse or drive back to the motel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to the motel,&rdquo; Hap decided. &ldquo;Jack and I
made a promise to Stony. We must at least make an
attempt to get Craig Warner&rsquo;s address and notify
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the map?&rdquo; War demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we might make a brief search for that too,&rdquo;
the Scout leader said with a grin at War&rsquo;s eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Stony say about gold nuggets being
hidden in a bag of pinto beans?&rdquo; War went on. &ldquo;And
what are pinto beans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pinto means mottled, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Jack recollected.
&ldquo;Stony must have meant some kind of fancy,
painted bean. And that reminds me! I did see a bag
of something hanging on the wall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; agreed Ken. &ldquo;On a hook near the
fireplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Stony had been struck, he raised up and
looked directly at that bag!&rdquo; Jack added. &ldquo;He seemed
relieved that it was still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if ever Old Stony had any valuables, it&rsquo;s
a cinch Jarrett Walz has them by now,&rdquo; Willie contributed
as the group left the hospital. &ldquo;Are we telling
him about our talk with the old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston decided. &ldquo;Stony
entrusted a secret to us. Let&rsquo;s keep it a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The Scouts had hoped to return to the motel without
meeting Walz again, but in this they were disappointed.
As their heavily laden car turned into the
driveway, the motel owner came out of his office.
His scowl told them that their unexpected return
did not please him.</p>
<p>However, he merely said: &ldquo;Back so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ran into complications,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston rejoined,
without explaining about the hospital trip.</p>
<p>Evidently, Walz had not learned that the Scouts
had gone to Old Stony&rsquo;s bedside, for he continued:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not figuring on staying here another night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we might,&rdquo; the Scout leader replied. &ldquo;It
all depends. You don&rsquo;t object, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Object? Why should I? Not if you pay your camp
fee. I&rsquo;d think, though, that you&rsquo;d want to hit the
road. There&rsquo;s nothing of interest to see in or around
Rocking Horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We like the place,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;I vote to stay
another day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; chimed in Willie.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston dug into his wallet and handed
the motel owner two dollars. For a moment, the
Scouts thought Walz intended to refuse, but with
a shrug he pocketed the bills and told them to go
back to their former camp site.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The Scouts busied themselves setting up the tents.
They had no intention of visiting Stony&rsquo;s cabin
while Jarrett Walz was near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep an eye on the motel office,&rdquo; Jack advised
Willie. &ldquo;If he leaves, that&rsquo;s our cue to go to
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Walz did not leave, and the Scouts began to
grow restless. Finally, Ken and Jack, without entering
the cabin, began to inspect the ground outside.
Without much hope of finding anything significant,
they searched for a clue to the identity of Stony&rsquo;s
mysterious attacker. Almost at once, Jarrett Walz
came out of the motel office. His sudden appearance
made it clear he had been watching them all the
while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you boys doing?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought we might find a few footprints,&rdquo; Jack replied
carelessly.</p>
<p>He stooped to inspect a large shoe imprint in a
moist spot of earth not far from the cabin door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s from my boot,&rdquo; Walz informed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; Jack agreed, noticing that the heel
print was identical with one made by the shoe Walz
wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those prints don&rsquo;t mean a thing. I&rsquo;ve been in and
out of that cabin several times this morning. Fancy
yourselves detectives, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Ken told him evenly, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;d like to find
out who attacked Stony. You reported the affair to
the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police were out here this morning. Reckon
they heard about it from the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any suspects?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a one. Police are satisfied the motive was
robbery. Probably some hoodlum who met Stony
was taken in by his story of having great wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re satisfied it was only a yarn?&rdquo; Jack asked,
watching the motel owner&rsquo;s face intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the gold? Sure. He had only that one nugget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walz eyed Jack shrewdly. &ldquo;Well, the old goat
might have had a map,&rdquo; he conceded. &ldquo;If so, he hid
it in a good place. He didn&rsquo;t give you any hints, did
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hints?&rdquo; Jack repeated, stalling for time. He had
no intention of disclosing his knowledge to the motel
owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what about this fellow Craig Warner?&rdquo; Ken
interposed, to distract Walz from the treasure map.
&ldquo;Do you know where he lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On some ranch in Colorado. That&rsquo;s all I can tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t find his address in those papers under
the bed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Walz answered shortly.</p>
<p>He might have added more, but just then a call
came from the motel office. Walz was gone about
ten minutes. When he returned, his face was grim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a telephone message from the hospital,&rdquo;
he reported. &ldquo;Stony&rsquo;s&mdash;dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken and Jack accepted the information in silence.
Though the sad news was not unexpected, it gave
them both an empty feeling to know that the old
fellow had indeed mounted his pale pony and ridden
to the Last Roundup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go to the hospital now,&rdquo; Walz went
on, looking worried. &ldquo;Arrangements have to be made
for the burial. I&rsquo;d let the county do it, but folks
would talk. So I&rsquo;ll dig down into my pocket, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts did not reply. After a while, Walz
went to his car and they saw him drive away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s our chance!&rdquo; Ken suggested. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
to do anything sneaky, but it&rsquo;s just as well Old
Eagle Eye doesn&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that poor Old Stony is gone, it&rsquo;s even more
important we find that map and Craig Warner&rsquo;s address,&rdquo;
Jack added.</p>
<p>Ken went for Mr. Livingston and the other Scouts.
The cabin door had not been locked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Once inside, the group turned to the box of papers
under the bed. The collection of letters was pathetically
small. There were two notes written by a
woman who signed herself Sadie, but the dates
were so far back, that even had there been an address,
she would probably have no longer been alive.</p>
<p>The Scouts could find no letters from Craig Warner.
They were about to give up the search when
Willie came upon the man&rsquo;s address written in a
tiny notebook with yellowed pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig Warner, Red Cliffs Ranch, Elks Creek,
Colorado,&rdquo; he read aloud. Mr. Livingston wrote
down the address and then the Scouts turned their
attention to the search for gold and the treasure
map. The bag of pinto beans had been removed from
the wall hook. However, Jack came upon it in a
corner of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bag was hanging on the wall last night,&rdquo;
he commented. &ldquo;I hope Jarrett Walz hasn&rsquo;t been
ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jack emptied the colored beans onto the bed,
the Scouts gathered around. But the sight was disappointing.
The bag contained nothing but beans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single nugget,&rdquo; War said in disgust. &ldquo;Old
Stony must have been handing us a line!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily,&rdquo; Jack replied, refilling the bag
and returning it to its former place on the wall hook.
&ldquo;Last night or this morning after Stony was taken
to the hospital, someone moved this bag.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>&ldquo;Walz?&rdquo; Willie asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be. Of course, the cabin door has been
unlocked, so maybe it&rsquo;s not fair to accuse him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a waste of time even looking for the
map,&rdquo; Willie said.</p>
<p>The others were inclined to agree with him. However,
no one would have willingly left the cabin
without making the search.</p>
<p>Jack and Ken dropped on hands and knees before
the fireplace. Raking away some of the loose,
cold ashes, they began to explore the hearthstones.</p>
<p>To their surprise they hit one which moved a trifle.</p>
<p>Jack pried it up with his knife. Beneath the stone
lay a yellowed paper, tightly folded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The map!&rdquo; he chortled. &ldquo;Old Stony&rsquo;s story may
be true!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 6</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE THREAT</span></h2>
<p>The Explorers and Mr. Livingston clustered close
to Jack, peering at the paper he had found under the
hearthstones. Carefully, he spread the yellowed
sheet on the cabin floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a map, all right,&rdquo; Ken confirmed, studying it
over Jack&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;A rough one, though. And
the ink has faded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The area on the map appeared to be in the most
rugged section of the Colorado Rockies, west of
Denver and toward the southwest portion of the
state. So far as the Scouts could determine, the take-off
point for Old Stony&rsquo;s Headless Hollow was a little
town which had been mapped in as Buckhorn. Other
landmarks were Cinnamon Pass and Superstition
Canyon. Headless Hollow itself seemed guarded by
twin mountain peaks, unnamed in the sketch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a map,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston conceded.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about all you can say for it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is drawn in proportion,&rdquo; Willie complained.
&ldquo;Most of the directions for reaching Headless
Hollow&mdash;if there is such a place&mdash;must have been
in Old Stony&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my bet he purposely made it vague,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably wanted to fix it so that nobody stealing
the map could have reached the valley too easily,&rdquo;
Ken agreed.</p>
<p>The Scouts politely waited for Mr. Livingston to
offer his opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We more or less made Old Stony a promise,&rdquo; he
reminded the group. &ldquo;So whether or not this map
has value, it&rsquo;s our duty to deliver it to Craig Warner
if we can find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may not be so easy,&rdquo; remarked Jack. &ldquo;Stony&rsquo;s
information isn&rsquo;t very up to date. Elks Creek may or
may not be a recent address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case&mdash;&rdquo; Happy started to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch it,&rdquo; Jack warned in an undertone.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash, he scooped the map from the
floor, thrusting it under his jacket.</p>
<p>The reason for his action was immediately apparent.
Footsteps had been heard on the gravel
driveway outside the cabin. Before the Scouts could
move away from the fireplace, Jarrett Walz loomed
on the threshold. His suspicious glance roved from
one face to another, but the Scouts volunteered no
explanation for their presence in the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>He said sharply: &ldquo;Well! I hardly expected to find
you here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t looking for you back so soon,&rdquo; Willie
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite obvious. What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No harm, I assure you,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said. &ldquo;To
be quite truthful, we promised Old Stony that if
anything happened to him, we&rsquo;d try to get in touch
with someone he knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig Warner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking after Stony&rsquo;s affairs is my job, not yours,&rdquo;
the motel owner said, his dark eyes snapping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not trying to intervene, we assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no business seeing my workman in the
hospital!&rdquo; Jarrett Walz continued, his voice rising.
&ldquo;Oh, you kept quiet about your visit there, but I
learned of it, all the same!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made no secret of our trip,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
replied. He was trying to remain polite, but the
motel owner&rsquo;s belligerent attitude annoyed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; War chimed in, glaring at Walz. &ldquo;We
went because the old man sent for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sent for you?&rdquo; the motel owner repeated, his
eyes glittering. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>War had told more than he intended. He began
to stall: &ldquo;Well, the old fellow was dying. He just
wanted to see us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;About what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just to see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must think me very stupid to accept that!
Why shouldn&rsquo;t he have sent for me? Here I&rsquo;ve given
him bed and board, but in his last hour, he turns
to five utter strangers! Folks in Rocking Horse will
say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston prompted, as the motel
owner interrupted himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll say Old Stony was ungrateful,&rdquo; Mr. Walz
completed. &ldquo;And he was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the shifty look of the motel operator&rsquo;s eyes,
the Scouts judged that he had checked himself on
the verge of saying something entirely different.
Though they had no evidence, it struck them that
in all probability over the years Jarrett Walz had
profited quite handsomely from the old prospector&rsquo;s
unpaid labor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any information on Stony&rsquo;s attacker?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I talked briefly with a police officer at the
hospital. Stony died from a heart attack, not the
results of the blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there will be no investigation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a routine one,&rdquo; Jarrett Walz answered with
a shrug, &ldquo;but whoever slugged Stony probably
hopped a train and blew out of town.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The Scouts were convinced that the motel owner
had succeeded in discouraging any police investigation.
Publicity no doubt would harm his business.
Though they did not like the way he had handled
the affair, they told themselves it really was none of
their concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, we may as well get back to our own
camp,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston suggested, edging toward
the door.</p>
<p>Jarrett Walz did not move aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll appreciate an explanation
before you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An explanation?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked, puzzled.
&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your presence in this cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scout adviser began to grow irritated, yet
he managed to keep his voice controlled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did explain, I think. We were looking for
Craig Warner&rsquo;s address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you intend to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notify Warner of Stony&rsquo;s death, naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he&rsquo;d care?&rdquo; Jarrett Walz demanded
with a slight sneer. &ldquo;I doubt he ever laid eyes on that
old coot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s beside the point. We made a promise to
Stony, and we intend to keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;A Scout&rsquo;s word is to be trusted, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Walz retorted triumphantly. &ldquo;Then tell
me the truth&mdash;no more of your double talk. You
came here to find more than an address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we did,&rdquo; the Scout leader rejoined. &ldquo;As
I recollect, you made a rather careful search of this
cabin yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; Walz said, immediately on the
defensive. &ldquo;Stony was my workman. You are strangers
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a point,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston conceded,
determined not to argue. &ldquo;I suggest you lock the
cabin door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like locking the barn after the horse is stolen!&rdquo;
Walz said, eying the Scout leader calculatingly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re deliberately hiding something! I think you
came here to find the old man&rsquo;s gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&mdash;&rdquo; War exclaimed, half lunging at the
motel owner.</p>
<p>Ken and Jack restrained him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spunky little tiger, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Walz demanded
with a hard, mirthless laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; drawled Jack, addressing the
motel owner, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re changing your tune about
the gold. Until now, you&rsquo;ve maintained Stony&rsquo;s tale
was fantastic.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;And so it is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one who should know,&rdquo; Willie said
significantly. &ldquo;You were the first to go through Old
Stony&rsquo;s things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts expected the motel owner to fly into
a rage at this accusation, but to their surprise he
shrugged it off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found nothing. Absolutely nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even in the bag of pinto beans?&rdquo; War asked.</p>
<p>Walz&rsquo; lips twitched, and a flush overspread his
ruddy cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see Old Stony did tell you quite a story,&rdquo; he
sneered. &ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t fool me! You weren&rsquo;t here
on any good-will mission. You were looking for gold
and a treasure map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve changed your idea about the map, too,&rdquo;
Jack accused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I have! Maybe I&rsquo;ve come to the conclusion
Old Stony told you a few things he never entrusted
to any other person in Rocking Horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conclude as you please,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said
shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m asking a straight question. Did you find a
map in this cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to learn that answer for yourself, my
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Walz and the Scout leader gazed steadily at one
another. Then abruptly the motel owner&rsquo;s manner
changed. He moved aside so that the Scouts could
file out the cabin door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the map,&rdquo; he said in an oddly quiet
voice. &ldquo;I knew it the moment I stepped into this
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one gave Walz the satisfaction of a reply.</p>
<p>He continued, his tone a warning: &ldquo;Just bear in
mind one thing. In trusting you with his secret, Old
Stony may have passed on to you his own misfortune&mdash;the
curse that hangs over Headless Hollow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 7</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">UNDER THE TENT FLAP</span></h2>
<p>Back in their own camp, the Explorers made certain
Jarrett Walz had not followed them.</p>
<p>Then, in the privacy of the larger tent, they eagerly
spread out the treasure map for a closer inspection.
Jack got the Colorado road guide from the car, and
they pored over it, trying to pinpoint Headless Hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such place,&rdquo; War announced after a
long study of the basic Colorado map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect to find Headless Hollow
printed in big red letters, did you?&rdquo; Ken demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was only a name Old Stony and his partner
gave the valley,&rdquo; Jack added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t find any of the landmarks either,&rdquo; War
grumbled, &ldquo;or that town where Craig Warner is
supposed to live&mdash;Elks Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be too small a place to be on a road map,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston returned. &ldquo;Buckhorn, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;This treasure map isn&rsquo;t drawn to scale, either,&rdquo;
Willie said with a frown. &ldquo;Most of the canyons and
mountain peaks aren&rsquo;t named. The main landmark
seems to be those twin peaks which guard the entrance
to the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going there, anyhow,&rdquo; Ken said, giving
him an amused, knowing look. &ldquo;So why worry about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it would be exciting to look for that cache
of gold,&rdquo; Willie retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could locate a take-off town it might not
be too far out of our way,&rdquo; War put in eagerly. &ldquo;How
about it, Hap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston smiled but shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No treasure hunting on this trip, boys. We&rsquo;re
supposed to be back in Belton City by the end of
the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a few days more or less wouldn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo;
War said carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little matter of money,&rdquo; Ken reminded
him. &ldquo;We have just enough, with a few dollars in
reserve, to make it home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; War admitted, crestfallen. &ldquo;But a fellow
can dream, can&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack continued to study the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make anything of it?&rdquo; Ken asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either on purpose, or because he was careless,
Stony made his markings vague. He was especially
slack about printing in names.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do with the map?&rdquo; Willie asked the
Scout leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our duty to turn it over to Craig Warner. Our
best bet will be to send him a wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telling him we have the map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Willie. Not in the first wire. We&rsquo;ll report
Stony&rsquo;s death and ask him to reply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had been the Scout plan to start on toward
Belton City, a journey of several days, but in view
of the promise made to Old Stony, they now were
uncertain what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already lost most of the morning,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston said, looking at his wristwatch. &ldquo;If I
get a telegram off right away, we might have a reply
by tonight if we&rsquo;re lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reflected a moment, then reached a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve paid for the site until tomorrow morning,
boys. If we&rsquo;re ever going to hear from Craig Warner,
we ought to have a reply by that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie and Warwick decided to ride into the main
section of town with the Scout adviser. Jack and
Ken agreed to watch the camp while the others were
dispatching the telegram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let Walz or anyone grab that map,&rdquo; Willie
warned, as the car pulled away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Left to themselves, Jack and Ken discussed Old
Stony for a while. Now that they were away from
the hospital and the magic of his voice, the tale of
treasure seemed farfetched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was just a fixation he had,&rdquo; Ken said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read of old prospectors drawing
maps of imaginary places. Then they&rsquo;d dream over
&rsquo;em so long they&rsquo;d convince themselves the treasure
was real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jarrett Walz seemed to think Stony&rsquo;s story mostly
hot air. At least, that&rsquo;s what he put out at first. But
if he didn&rsquo;t believe it, why did he paw through
everything in the cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Including that bag of pinto beans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, Ken, it&rsquo;s just possible he found a few nuggets
in the beans&mdash;enough to get him excited about
the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think of his crack about the curse
of Headless Hollow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melodrama. Maybe he wanted to discourage us
from going there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so,&rdquo; Ken grinned, &ldquo;he went about it the wrong
Way. He should know that adventure is our dish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walz may know more about Old Stony&rsquo;s past than
he&rsquo;s letting on,&rdquo; Jack said thoughtfully. &ldquo;You notice
he gets his statements mixed. Another thing, he
poohpoohs the idea of a treasure, but he seems wild
to get his hands on this map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken nodded. &ldquo;We should hide it in a safe spot.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in our duffel bags. That would be the first
place he&rsquo;d look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s eye fell upon the tent flap. &ldquo;Why not under
there?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;At least until Hap gets back
with the car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Folding the map into a tiny square, they hid it
under the tent flap. Then, satisfied that it would be
safe, they set about preparing lunch.</p>
<p>By the time Mr. Livingston, War, and Willie drove
up, a big pot of stew was giving off a delightful
aroma. Ken made tea and tossed a handful of raisins
in the boiling rice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; Jack asked the Scout leader, as they
all sat down at a picnic table to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of consequence. We sent off the telegram.
The telegraph company agent promised to
telephone us here if there is any answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Stony?&rdquo; Ken questioned, after a
moment. &ldquo;Police haven&rsquo;t caught that fellow who attacked
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. We dropped around at the station. Apparently,
Jarrett Walz was right&mdash;the investigation
won&rsquo;t be carried on with any vigor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;about the arrangements&mdash;Stony&rsquo;s burial?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow at 10 A.M. The town is providing for
a simple service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Walz, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s contributing a small amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to chip in for flowers,&rdquo; Jack said soberly.
&ldquo;Even if our money is short, we can manage it, can&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jack,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston nodded. &ldquo;While we
were in town, we arranged for a wreath. It seemed
the least we could do. Stony was a stranger and yet,
somehow, he moved us all deeply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a queer feeling about him,&rdquo; War added,
staring at his plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of feeling?&rdquo; Ken asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to explain.&rdquo; War groped for words. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
as if his ghost were here&mdash;sort o&rsquo; nudging us on&mdash;saying
we should follow the lead he gave us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one laughed.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Livingston said, &ldquo;If we hear from
Craig Warner, and Elks Creek isn&rsquo;t too many miles
out of our way, we could deliver the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This thought at once caused the Explorers to become
more cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About going on to Buckhorn&mdash;&rdquo; War began, but
Mr. Livingston shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of time and money, Warwick. After
all, we&rsquo;ve had our vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;And a dandy one it was!&rdquo; announced Jack, beginning
to gather up the cups. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to grieve
over Old Stony&rsquo;s hidden gold. Quit your coaxing,
War, and get those dishes done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after 2 P. M., as the Scouts restlessly idled
about camp, they saw Jarrett Walz drive up. From
the way he slammed the door as he went into the
motel office, they judged he was in a bad mood. This
was made even more evident a few minutes later
when he tramped down the road to ask them if they
had decided when they would leave Rocking Horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow some time, probably,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our town seems to have quite an attraction for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certainly taking a deep interest in Stony&rsquo;s
unfortunate affairs,&rdquo; the motel owner went on, scowling.
&ldquo;I heard about that telegram you sent to Craig
Warner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! News travels fast in Rocking Horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does. I might say you seem to be assuming
responsibilities. Some might have a less polite name
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since you hit this town, you&rsquo;ve been sticking
your nose into affairs that don&rsquo;t concern you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry if it seems that way to you,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said with a shrug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you send a wire to Craig Warner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To notify him of Old Stony&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t your sole reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all the answers,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston replied,
finding it hard to keep his temper. &ldquo;Why
bother to ask any questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I strongly suspect Old Stony told you
something you&rsquo;re hiding from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston made up his mind to end the unpleasant
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We promised Stony we would get in touch with
the son of his old partner. That&rsquo;s why we sent the
telegram. Tomorrow we&rsquo;ll be away from here, and
you can handle affairs as you see fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reply obviously did not satisfy Jarrett Walz
but, apparently realizing his tactics would get him
nowhere, he went away.</p>
<p>For the Scouts it was a long, boring day. With
nothing to do, the hours dragged. All began to look
forward to the morrow when they would take to the
road once more. Twice Mr. Livingston and Ken
drove to the telegraph office to inquire if an answer
had been received to the wire. No word had come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;Craig Warner may not exist except in Old Stony&rsquo;s
mind,&rdquo; the Scout leader observed upon his return
to camp at dusk, &ldquo;or he may have moved to another
community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do about the map?&rdquo; Willie asked in
a troubled voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s no reply by morning, I think the best
thing to do is send it by registered mail,&rdquo; the Scout
adviser decided.</p>
<p>The warm night closed in somewhat cloudy. After
supper, the Scouts sat for a while about the camp
fire, cracking a few jokes and trying to shake themselves
into a more cheerful mood. Old Stony&rsquo;s death
hung over them, and they could not seem to get him
out of their thoughts. It was depressing to look at
his darkened cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to leave in the morning,&rdquo; Jack said,
preparing to turn in for the night. &ldquo;Up at crack of
dawn, you guys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire burned out, and the camp quieted. Jack,
with the health of youth, slept soundly. Now and
then he aroused briefly as cars drove into the motel
section of the parking lot, but quickly he dozed off
again.</p>
<p>Then suddenly he was awake once more. For a
second, he could not imagine what had aroused him.
But as he lay still, listening, he distinctly heard
the crackle of a twig.</p>
<p>He crept to the door of the shelter, peering out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The night was very dark but, even without switching
on a flashlight, he could see a man moving
stealthily toward the Scout automobile parked beyond
the picnic tables.</p>
<p>As Jack watched in growing anger, the fellow
deliberately tested the car doors to see if they were
locked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 8</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WALZ&rsquo; PROPOSITION</span></h2>
<p>The tall fellow, who crouched by the car, picked
up a rock. Guessing that he meant to smash the
door handle, Jack let out a wild yell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get away from there, you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man dropped the rock. Startled, he whirled
and ran for the trees. Jack took after him, but he did
not have on his shoes. The rocks and stones slashed
his feet and impeded him.</p>
<p>The intruder, amazingly fast in retreat, vanished
behind the motel buildings. Losing sight of him,
Jack finally limped back to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; Willie greeted him. &ldquo;You
made more noise than a tribe of Indians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky I did, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the Scouts and Mr. Livingston were awake
by now. They pressed Jack for an explanation.</p>
<p>Recovering breath, he said in disgust: &ldquo;I let him
get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who got away?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t know. Someone was trying
to break into the sedan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>Mr. Livingston went over to try the car doors.
All remained locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I yelled and scared him away before he managed
to break the handle,&rdquo; Jack went on. &ldquo;You know&mdash;he
looked a lot like that fellow we saw streaking away
from Stony&rsquo;s cabin last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The attacker?&rdquo; Willie interposed. &ldquo;S-a-y, maybe
it was the same guy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And maybe it&rsquo;s lucky we weren&rsquo;t slugged in our
sleep!&rdquo; War added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He acted as if his main objective was the
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing in there except some of our unpacked
luggage,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said thoughtfully. &ldquo;He
could have been after the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or something he believed might be hidden or
locked up there,&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The map!&rdquo; exclaimed Ken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it struck me,&rdquo; Jack nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
we hid it under the tent flap. Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s still
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has to be,&rdquo; Ken returned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in camp
every minute since you hid it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to reassure themselves, the Scouts
peered beneath the flap. When folded back, it served
as an open doorway. When lowered, it provided a
curtain across the front opening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Still here,&rdquo; Jack said in relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that guy wasn&rsquo;t after it at all,&rdquo; Ken said
doubtfully. &ldquo;Who would know we have the
map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jarrett Walz, for one,&rdquo; piped up Willie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t picture him coming to our camp at night,&rdquo;
Ken said. &ldquo;Did it look like Walz, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not especially. I didn&rsquo;t get a glimpse of anything
but his back. He lit out like a house afire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, he&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said,
yawning. &ldquo;We may have a rough day tomorrow. So
I suggest we try to get a little more sleep before
dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the Scouts settled down. Throughout
the remainder of the night, the only disturbing
sound was the rumble of traffic past the motel office.</p>
<p>Jack was up with the sun. He and Willie were
starting to prepare breakfast, when they heard the
crunch of gravel. Looking around, they saw Mr.
Walz approaching the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble,&rdquo; Willie muttered.</p>
<p>However, he was wrong. The motel owner seemed
to be in a most pleasant mood. In fact, he carried a
covered dish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, boys,&rdquo; he greeted them. &ldquo;My
wife sent over these hot biscuits. We thought you&rsquo;d
like a taste of home cooking for a change.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Willie opened his jaws to let fall a stinging comment.
Then he closed his lips firmly and kept his
thoughts to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;Biscuits will go fine with
our bacon and eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife sent some jam, too. Nothing like a good
breakfast before you hit the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Willie exchanged a quick glance. They
figured they knew the reason behind the motel
owner&rsquo;s unexpected generosity. He was eager to
speed them on their way!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your leader anywhere around?&rdquo; Walz inquired,
after he had set the pan down on a stump near the
camp fire.</p>
<p>Just then Mr. Livingston came out of the tent
carrying his shaving equipment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, good morning,&rdquo; Mr. Walz cried
heartily. &ldquo;I hope you had a good night&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not especially. Someone tried to break into our
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a show of concern, Mr. Walz asked for details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; know,&rdquo; the motel owner said, after they had
explained, &ldquo;now that Stony is gone, I&rsquo;ll have to hire
someone&mdash;a more active man&mdash;to guard these
grounds at night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had trouble before?&rdquo; the Scout leader
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not until night before last. I was told, though,
that a suspicious-looking character was seen loitering
around here yesterday while I was away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mention it to us last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t want to alarm you. It may be he&rsquo;s the
same fellow who got into poor Old Stony&rsquo;s cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve notified the police, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; Mr. Walz admitted, avoiding the Scout
leader&rsquo;s direct gaze. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have enough evidence
to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, you thought Stony&rsquo;s attacker blew town
yesterday. Remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; the motel man agreed with a
self-conscious laugh.</p>
<p>By this time, the Scouts had no faith in Walz&rsquo;
word, and he seemed to be aware of the unfavorable
impression he had created.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been very upset about the attack on Stony,&rdquo;
he went on. &ldquo;And all the talk about his gold and
a treasure map worries me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should that worry you?&rdquo; Ken drawled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said before, I seriously doubt there is any
gold&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place he calls Headless Hollow&mdash;&rdquo;
War exclaimed, and then faltered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;Headless Hollow,&rdquo; Mr. Walz repeated softly.
&ldquo;So he did tell you about that place in the Colorado
Rockies? And he gave you the map too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stony wasn&rsquo;t taking anything with him when he
went to the hospital,&rdquo; Jack reminded the motel
owner. &ldquo;As I recall, you were the first to go through
his things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were close on my heels!&rdquo; Walz brought
himself up short. &ldquo;However, I didn&rsquo;t come here to
quarrel. I know you have the map and, as a gentleman,
I request that you show it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had Walz made his request in this manner the
previous day, the Scouts would have allowed him
to inspect the paper they had found. Now, distrusting
his motives, they were unwilling to produce the
map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit we do
have a piece of paper Stony left. But it must be
delivered to Craig Warner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s why you sent him a telegram yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a minute, the Scouts thought Jarrett Walz
would storm and object. He seemed to gain control
of himself only after an inward struggle. When he
spoke, his voice was friendly, cheerful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you how I took care of Stony for years&mdash;gave
him a job, clothing, food&mdash;everything. Ask
anyone in Rocking Horse if it isn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, I have no desire for personal gain,&rdquo;
Walz resumed. &ldquo;I do feel that if Stony left any money
or a rich claim, I should be entitled to repayment
for a portion of what I&rsquo;ve put out in his behalf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems fair enough,&rdquo; the Scout leader agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stony told me dozens of times he intended me
to have everything he owned. At the very end, he
turned against me&mdash;only because his mind was failing.
He began to think of Craig Warner&mdash;a man he
never saw in his lifetime, so far as I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That probably is so,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston conceded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m willing enough the map should go to
Craig Warner, if that was Stony&rsquo;s last wish. But
who knows where Warner is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had no luck in getting in touch with him
so far,&rdquo; the Scout leader admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Suppose you never find him? Then what
becomes of the map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston replied that he had given no
thought to that possibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; Walz said, speaking slowly,
&ldquo;that if you fail to find Warner, the map ought to be
turned over to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your request is a reasonable one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d see it my way,&rdquo; Walz said in
relief. &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s settled. Turn the map over to me,
and I&rsquo;ll do my best to find Warner. If I don&rsquo;t find
him, I&rsquo;ll keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said, smiling broadly.
&ldquo;We made a promise to Stony, and we shall do all
we can to find Craig Warner ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; the Scout leader replied. &ldquo;We just
feel we owe it to Stony to deliver the map ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you fail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there may be no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t
have it. The Scouts, I assure you, have no intention
of going on a wild gold chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When it became clear to the motel owner that he
could not move Mr. Livingston, he asked, &ldquo;Then
how do you plan to deliver the map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The safest way would be to take it to Elks
Creek&mdash;if there is such a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elks Creek is a real place, all right,&rdquo; Walz informed
him, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s an out-of-the way cow town off
the main highway. I could take you there, only my
car is out of commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts waited, wondering what the motel
owner had in mind. It was obvious that he was leading
up to something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is my proposition,&rdquo; Walz said. &ldquo;Elks Creek
isn&rsquo;t any more than seventy-five or one hundred
miles out of your way, if you&rsquo;re traveling east. Take
me along, and I&rsquo;ll pay the entire cost of the trip from
here to Craig Warner&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite themselves, the Scouts were rather
amazed at the generous offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one little string attached to my offer,&rdquo;
the motel owner added. &ldquo;If we fail to find Craig
Warner, then I&rsquo;ll expect you to hand over the map.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 9</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SHORT CUT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how about it?&rdquo; Jarrett Walz asked impatiently,
as the Scouts stood mute. &ldquo;My proposition
is a fair one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston acknowledged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why hesitate? Are you afraid to team up
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re not afraid, Mr. Walz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m trying to outwit you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re taken by surprise,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston replied.
&ldquo;You offer to pay all the expenses of the trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. That is, from here to Elks Creek. Meals.
Overnight lodging, if we have to hole up in Colorado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you hope to gain from such an arrangement?&rdquo;
Hap went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, probably. The chances are we&rsquo;ll find
Craig Warner and turn the map over to him. But
if no such person exists, the map will be mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you rate the map so highly?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Walz began to feel hemmed in by his own conflicting
statements. He hesitated, then said, &ldquo;I want that
map. Maybe I misled you at first because I didn&rsquo;t
know anything about you or your motives. But
there&rsquo;s an outside chance Stony&rsquo;s map may have
some value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts were far more inclined to trust the
motel owner now that he made a frank admission of
his interest in the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you say?&rdquo; he prodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to think it over,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
stalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will you need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We figured on going to the telegraph office
again before we pull out&mdash;and to the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet you here at eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Walz suggested.
&ldquo;By that time, I must have your answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have it,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston promised. &ldquo;If
we should accept, how soon could you be ready to
leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In ten minutes. All I need to do is toss a few
things into a suitcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you at eleven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
replied.</p>
<p>Over breakfast, the Scouts discussed the matter,
finding it difficult to reach a decision. They still
distrusted Jarrett Walz. On the other hand, it seemed
selfish to deny him a ride to Elks Creek when his
own car was not in good running order.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s offered to pay all expenses,&rdquo; War reminded
the group as he reached for a second biscuit.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite an item.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for taking him up,&rdquo; said Willie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d get
back to Belton City with cash in our treasury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston gazed at Jack and Ken, waiting
to hear their opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jack admitted frankly. &ldquo;On the
surface it looks okay, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel the same,&rdquo; said Ken. &ldquo;Before making a
decision, why not inquire in town as to Walz&rsquo; reputation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good suggestion,&rdquo; the Scout adviser answered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it on our trip to the telegraph station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After breakfast, the Scouts struck camp, packing
everything into the car and transferring the map
to Mr. Livingston&rsquo;s billfold for safekeeping. As they
started to pull out of the parking yard, Mr. Walz
came rushing out of the motel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we aren&rsquo;t leaving for good,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston reassured him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see you at eleven
o&rsquo;clock as we promised.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>At the telegraph office, the Scouts were told that
no answer had been received to their telegram. Then
they stopped at the post office and the bank. While
the Scouts were mailing cards home, Mr. Livingston
made a few inquiries about Mr. Walz. The information
he received was not very helpful. However,
the motel owner seemed to be well regarded in the
community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I can gather, this is the picture,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston told the Explorers. &ldquo;Walz did give Stony
a home when the old fellow wasn&rsquo;t able to do much
work. He&rsquo;s considered a hard driver but fair. Stony
wasn&rsquo;t too grateful for what he received.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we misjudged Walz,&rdquo; Jack said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s our decision?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we lose by taking him up?&rdquo; Willie
argued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others offered no objection, so it was decided
that Walz&rsquo; proposition should be accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a word of warning,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston advised.
&ldquo;Walz knows we have the map. Let&rsquo;s not tell him
who has it, or give him any detail of what it
shows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I know him, he&rsquo;ll try to pry it out of us,&rdquo; War
chuckled. &ldquo;But my lips are sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts attended Stony&rsquo;s funeral along with
a few townspeople, and Walz was not present. When
they drove back to the motel, he was waiting for
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My suitcase is packed,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking our acceptance for granted?&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston remarked dryly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;Figured you wouldn&rsquo;t turn it down,&rdquo; the motel
owner said with a grin. &ldquo;Where do I ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie slid out of the front seat to make room
for him and crowded into the back with War and
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want, I can take the wheel,&rdquo; Walz offered,
once his suitcase had been stowed away. &ldquo;I know
this road like a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said, &ldquo;but thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Explorers had decided to be cordial to Walz,
and therefore they kept up a polite conversation. The
motel owner was in a good mood and seemingly had
an endless stock of stories to relate. At first the Scouts
did not mind, but after an hour or so they began to
weary of his chatter.</p>
<p>When the car made its first stop at a filling station
to get gas, true to his bargain Walz paid the bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll be okay, after all,&rdquo; Willie remarked
to Jack as they checked the tires before driving on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Jack agreed. &ldquo;Time will tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once the party was well beyond the Colorado
border, Walz began to suggest short-cut roads which
he said would greatly reduce the mileage. Feeling
that the motel owner knew the country, Mr. Livingston
and the Explorers accepted his advice. But
as the roads became increasingly poor, they wondered
if they actually were saving any time. Late
in the afternoon, when they were confronted with
a choice of highways, Mr. Livingston stopped the car
so as to study the road map.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. 416 will take us directly into Elks Creek,&rdquo;
Hap said. &ldquo;With luck, we ought to get there before
dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his forefinger, Walz traced another route.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 40 miles shorter this way,&rdquo; he pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your short cuts haven&rsquo;t worked out so far,&rdquo; the
Scout leader objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know this country,&rdquo; said Walz. &ldquo;This road
is paved all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, if you&rsquo;re sure,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said,
&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like the look of the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black, fast-moving clouds were swirling over the
distant mountain peaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it may rain a little,&rdquo; Walz replied carelessly.
&ldquo;All the more reason for taking the shorter road that&rsquo;s
paved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The highway he had insisted on taking ran for a
while through desolate territory, and they didn&rsquo;t
meet any other cars. There were no houses or filling
stations, and the only persons they saw along the
road were occasional Indians. However, the highway
was paved, as Walz had said. Instead of having
bridges, the road dipped down through dry creek
beds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Jack called attention to a sign which read: &ldquo;Notice
to Motorists: Do not attempt to cross if creek is
running more than six inches deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes these creeks come up fast,&rdquo; Walz explained
carelessly. &ldquo;The mountains feed the streams
at a terrific rate, especially if there&rsquo;s been a heavy
downpour above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheerful thought,&rdquo; commented Ken, studying the
clouds again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read of cars being swept away,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
remarked. &ldquo;Maybe we should have taken the
other road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walz regarded him scornfully. &ldquo;Why, the creeks
are bone dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be for long,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston replied.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s starting to rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huge drops splashed the windshield. Faster and
faster they came down. Mr. Livingston suggested
pulling up until the rain was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be an hour,&rdquo; Walz rasped. He was
looking worried. &ldquo;This is coming down like a regular
cloudburst. If we don&rsquo;t get through this area,
we&rsquo;ll be trapped maybe for half a day between
creeks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>The Scouts said nothing. They were deeply annoyed,
however, that the motel owner by his stubborn
insistence had brought them to this sorry situation.
Mr. Livingston hesitated and then decided
to accept Walz&rsquo; advice. He drove on.</p>
<p>Rain was already falling so fast that it became
difficult for him to see the road ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful!&rdquo; the Scout leader gasped. &ldquo;We
ought to stop&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Walz shouted. &ldquo;Another creek lies ahead.
Once we get through that, we&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a mile or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a worried shake of his head, Mr. Livingston
kept on. Rain fell in a deluge, threatening to damp
out the car motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The creek is just ahead,&rdquo; Walz encouraged him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How deep is the water running?&rdquo; the Scout leader
demanded.</p>
<p>Water sprayed the windshield and he could not
make out even the drop-off of the pavement into
the depression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be okay,&rdquo; Walz assured him. &ldquo;The rain hasn&rsquo;t
been falling long. Keep on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston obeyed and immediately regretted
it. The moment the car rolled down into the creek
bed, he saw that the water was far higher than he
had imagined. It swirled angrily around the tires
and kept creeping higher. Too late, Mr. Livingston
saw he could not back out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers!&rdquo; Walz exclaimed. &ldquo;The rain must have
started earlier in the mountains! Keep going, man!
Keep going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston was doing his best, but the motor
sputtered and died.</p>
<p>The car rolled a few feet farther and stopped
in the lowest point of the raging torrent.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 10</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TRICKERY</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in it now!&rdquo; Walz shrieked, staring in horror
at the fast-rising water. &ldquo;The car will be swept
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston tried desperately to get the motor
started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have seen the water was too deep
for a crossing!&rdquo; Walz whimpered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rising so fast
you can see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken, who was riding in the center of the front
seat, shoved past the motel owner and got out of
the car. Jack, Willie and War, in the back seat, followed
suit. The water was up to their knees and
rising unbelievably fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Altogether, push!&rdquo; Jack ordered.</p>
<p>The four applied their shoulders and shoved. The
car moved ahead through the swirling, raging water,
but could not make the steep incline. Back it rolled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again!&rdquo; Jack urged.</p>
<p>Walz did not offer to help, though he must have
known that his strength was vitally needed in this
desperate race against time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never get &rsquo;er out,&rdquo; Willie muttered in despair.</p>
<p>Once more the Scouts heaved, and again the car
began to roll. This time, as the uphill grade became
too much of a barrier, Mr. Livingston helped move
the car on the battery. Inch by inch it crept up the
sloping bank to the higher road above.</p>
<p>War made a last powerful shove, lost his balance,
and sprawled in the torrent. Jack grabbed him, and
they all splashed out of the stream. Wet and bedraggled,
they climbed back into the car to consider their
plight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect the spark plug is damp,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said, getting out a handkerchief with which to
wipe it. &ldquo;The engine stalled even before we hit the
deep water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite protests from the Scouts, he took his turn
in the rain. Walz, however, made no offer to help.
Scowling, he sat huddled in the steamy car.</p>
<p>After twenty minutes of fussing with the spark
plug, the Scout leader managed to get the engine
started again. By that time, the rain had slackened
considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more creek beds ahead?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
asked Walz as the car crept forward once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Walz snapped. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re blaming
me for what happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anyone making any complaints,&rdquo;
the Scout leader replied. &ldquo;An accident is an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t my fault. How was I to know there
had been a cloudburst up in the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always a wise precaution&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
started to say and then cut himself off. He finished:
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re lucky we didn&rsquo;t lose the car, or at least
damage it. The rain has almost stopped, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their wet clothes and shoes the Scouts were
rather uncomfortable. At the first filling station,
thirty miles farther on, they stopped, unpacked the
luggage, and changed into dry clothing.</p>
<p>Walz fretted at the delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be after dark before we get to Elks Creek,&rdquo;
he complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Jack replied shortly. &ldquo;Sometimes the
shortest road is the longest way to a destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real philosophical, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Walz asked, his
lips curling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>To Jack, it was plain that the motel owner found
it hard to hold his temper in check. Obviously he
had no liking for the Scouts or Mr. Livingston and
tolerated their company only to gain his objective.
As for the Explorers, they now had even less respect
for Walz than they had had before. His judgment,
they thought, had been proven faulty. He was sullen,
selfish, and, in addition, he had a cowardly streak.</p>
<p>After the rain, night came on fast. The Scouts
would have preferred to camp, but Walz kept insisting
that they push on to Elks Creek. Actually, it
was 9:25 P.M. when the car finally pulled into that
little mountainside hamlet. There was no suitable
camp site, and for once the wearied Scouts had no
enthusiasm about finding one.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston suggested that they all spend the
night at the town&rsquo;s only hotel, an unimposing
wooden structure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At my expense, naturally,&rdquo; Mr. Walz said sarcastically.</p>
<p>The Scout leader shot him a quizzical look. &ldquo;It
was your proposition&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was! Well, I&rsquo;m not kicking. Not if you keep
your end of the bargain. If we fail to find Craig
Warner, you turn the map over to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if we&rsquo;re convinced he can&rsquo;t possibly be
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late tonight to try to find Red Cliffs
Ranch,&rdquo; Walz went on. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll register at this dump
of a hotel. While you&rsquo;re getting some supper, I&rsquo;ll
make a few inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The Scouts took rooms, cleaned themselves up a
bit, and joined Mr. Livingston in the dining room.
A silent, shy waitress served them an excellent meal
consisting of steak, potatoes, and fresh peas. For
dessert came large cuts of juicy apple pie with big
wedges of cheese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is real food!&rdquo; Willie said with relish.
&ldquo;A mighty welcome change from that eternal stew
Jack is always feeding us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just for that, you&rsquo;ll get beans next time!&rdquo; Jack
retorted good-naturedly. &ldquo;Such gratitude!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best part of this meal is that it&rsquo;s free,&rdquo; War
chortled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; responded Mr. Livingston as he signed
the check with Walz&rsquo; name. &ldquo;But sometimes things
don&rsquo;t work out as we expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning Walz is likely to welch on the deal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he gets what he wants, War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if he doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in that case, we may see fireworks. I have
a hunch&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston left his remark unfinished, for Jack
flashed him a warning glance. Jarrett Walz had just
come into the dining room. Crossing over to the
Scouts&rsquo; table, he sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, friends,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a few inquiries.
The outcome is just about what I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig Warner doesn&rsquo;t live here?&rdquo; Ken asked
quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;He did live here years ago. Then he moved north.
Three years ago, he died of pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig Warner&rsquo;s dead?&rdquo; War echoed flatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It&rsquo;s disappointing but, frankly, I expected
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You expected it?&rdquo; Jack asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s no more than I expected. Stony probably
hadn&rsquo;t written to Warner in six or eight
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems our trip here is without purpose,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston observed, looking down at his plate. &ldquo;I
admit I am disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be starting back to Rocking Horse early tomorrow
morning,&rdquo; Walz said briskly. &ldquo;I can catch
a train at nine o&rsquo;clock. You boys will probably want
to get an early start east, so the best thing would
be to give it to me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The map?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally. That was the agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you sure Craig Warner is dead?&rdquo; the
Scout leader demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dozen people told me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you give me their names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You doubt my word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but in a matter such as this, we can&rsquo;t afford
to make a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t recall to whom I talked,&rdquo; Walz said with
a scowl. &ldquo;But the dope was straight. Warner is dead.
I&rsquo;ve kept my agreement. Now I want that map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See us in the morning at breakfast,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said suavely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I have to take an early train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be up before seven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
promised him. &ldquo;Meet us here at seven thirty. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walz started to argue, then suddenly changed his
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Breakfast at seven thirty.
Get a good sleep. You still have a long ride before
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In leaving the dining room, the Scouts casually
inquired of the hotel owner if he knew anyone by
the name of Craig Warner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of him,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Once the Scouts were in Mr. Livingston&rsquo;s room,
they discussed turning the map over to the motel
owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have to do it in the morning,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said reluctantly, &ldquo;but, somehow, his information
doesn&rsquo;t satisfy me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not do a little checking of our own?&rdquo; Jack
proposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>The idea appealed to the others. It was decided,
though, that Walz might become resentful if he
saw the entire crew leaving the hotel. So Jack and
Ken were assigned to tour the town to see what
they could learn.</p>
<p>The two were away from the hotel more than an
hour. When finally they returned, they fairly burst
into the Scout leader&rsquo;s room where the others had
gathered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you find out?&rdquo; War demanded, getting
up from the bed where he had been sprawling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty!&rdquo; Jack announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We talked to three people,&rdquo; Ken said. &ldquo;The first
two had never heard of Craig Warner. Then we ran
into an old-timer, a rancher who has lived in this
country most of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; Willie asked impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig Warner is very much alive,&rdquo; Jack announced.
&ldquo;In fact, he lives less than forty miles from
here&mdash;not at Red Cliffs Ranch, though. Another
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Walz lied!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ken and I think so,&rdquo; Jack said soberly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
made up his mind to get that map at any cost. And
it&rsquo;s up to us to prevent him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 11</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">CLOUD CREST RANCH</span></h2>
<p>Jarrett Walz was waiting in the hotel dining room
when the Explorers entered promptly at seven thirty
the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, right on time, I see,&rdquo; he greeted them
jovially. &ldquo;You brought the map?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston did not reply. He and the Scouts
seated themselves at the circular, old-fashioned table
and ordered breakfast. The motel owner could not
conceal his impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought the map?&rdquo; he repeated as soon as
the waitress went away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for turning it over to you,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
replied, &ldquo;we have a different plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walz&rsquo; bushy eyebrows jerked up in surprise.
&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean, a different plan?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig Warner happens to be alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We checked your information last night, Mr.
Walz. I&rsquo;m afraid you obtained it from unreliable
sources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flush slowly overspread the motel owner&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Craig Warner isn&rsquo;t dead?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He is operating a ranch less than forty miles
from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A place called Cloud Crest,&rdquo; supplied Jack, enjoying
Walz&rsquo; discomfiture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m mighty glad to hear it,&rdquo; the motel owner
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made further inquiry,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
resumed. &ldquo;Cloud Crest is off the main road in a
rather inaccessible place. In dry weather, however,
it can be reached by car. Fortunately, yesterday&rsquo;s
downpour missed this area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warner hasn&rsquo;t been to town in a month,&rdquo; Ken
added. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he never replied to our telegram.
It&rsquo;s waiting here, if he ever shows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walz sat for a long moment, staring at the tablecloth.
The waitress brought pancakes and hot sausages,
but he scarcely touched his food. The Scouts,
on the other hand, ate heartily.</p>
<p>When they had finished, Walz said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be
starting on East now, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until we&rsquo;ve delivered the map,&rdquo; the Scout
leader answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be at least eighty miles out of your way,
counting the return trip,&rdquo; the motel owner pointed
out. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to figure on killing an entire day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what! I can save you that trip. Let me
have the map, and I&rsquo;ll see that Craig Warner gets it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston shook his head. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d prefer to
deliver it ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made Old Stony a promise, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve become very devoted to his memory,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Walz asked with a slight sneer. &ldquo;You
think I deceived you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did we make any such accusation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can tell by the way you act! I&rsquo;ve paid
your expenses. I&rsquo;ve been open and above board in
all my dealings. You&rsquo;ve done nothing in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve kept our agreement, Mr. Walz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least let me see that map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re turning it over to Mr. Warner,&rdquo; the Scout
leader said patiently. &ldquo;After he gets it, if he wants
to he can show it to you or do whatever he pleases.
Until then&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walz suddenly got to his feet, pushing back his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he rasped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through paying your bills.
Settle your own hotel account. I&rsquo;m finished with
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode from the dining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good riddance,&rdquo; grinned Willie. &ldquo;We never
should have teamed up with him. Wonder how
much we owe here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said, a bit grimly. &ldquo;We
can handle it, though. I half figured on a deal such
as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hurriedly, the Scouts finished breakfast and gathered
together their belongings. Jack obtained detailed
instructions for reaching Cloud Crest Ranch.
Mr. Livingston settled the hotel bill, which was not
so high as he had expected, and they drove out of
Elks Creek without seeing Walz again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re finished with him,&rdquo; War said cheerfully,
settling down for a long ride over a rutty road.
&ldquo;What did you learn about Warner, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. They say he&rsquo;s an able rancher but
has had a run of hard luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow we talked to said he&rsquo;s a square
shooter,&rdquo; Ken contributed. &ldquo;Peculiar, though&mdash;the
lone-wolf type. His exact words were: &lsquo;If Warner
likes you, he&rsquo;ll give you the shirt off his back. If
he doesn&rsquo;t, watch out! He judges a man fast, and
once an opinion is formed, he doesn&rsquo;t change his
mind.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope he takes a liking to us,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
remarked. &ldquo;Not that it matters. We&rsquo;ll give him
the map and be on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car made slow time on the winding dirt road.
However, the way was scenic, if dusty. Rugged,
snow-tipped mountains rimmed the valley. Their
high peaks were circled with lazy, fleecy clouds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>The hot sun was high overhead when the car
wound along a stream of fast-running water and
emerged into a clearing.</p>
<p>A short distance ahead the Scouts saw a long log
cabin, a barn, and a fenced area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloud Crest Ranch,&rdquo; Jack read on the gatepost.</p>
<p>He jumped out to unbar the gate so that the car
could pass through. Carefully, he closed it again
before they drove on to the ranch house.</p>
<p>The car&rsquo;s approach was evidently noted from the
building for, as the Scouts alighted in front of the
ranch building, a man who was nearly six feet tall,
lean and muscular, came out the door.</p>
<p>At first glance they took him to be in his thirties,
but as he came closer they saw the shock of gray hair
and the lines on his face which made him seem
to be in his fifties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rancher was soft spoken, and he looked
straight at the Scouts as he greeted them. He wore
a red shirt and brown riding breeches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig Warner?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston gave his name and introduced
the Explorers. Since the rancher did not invite them
into the house, Mr. Livingston decided to make the
visit brief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Going straight to the point, he told Mr. Warner
of Old Stony&rsquo;s death and his request that the map
to the Headless Hollow region be delivered to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; Warner exclaimed. &ldquo;You know, I never
could figure out why that old fellow kept writing to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never knew that he was your father&rsquo;s partner?&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I was just a kid when my father went off
into the mountains prospecting, and he never came
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stony didn&rsquo;t tell you his connection with your
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rancher shook his head. &ldquo;No. I answered only
one of his letters, I think. I couldn&rsquo;t see any sense
in writing a stranger, so I let the correspondence
lapse. Stony, as you call him, never mentioned my
father, except to say he had known him. But he did
let on he owed me a great debt. I never could figure
that out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sent you a map,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said. &ldquo;A
chart to an area where he claims there is a cache
of gold. He called it Headless Hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard of it?&rdquo; Jack asked, noticing the
startled expression of the rancher&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes. Not by that name. But it must be
the same isolated valley where my father lost his
life&mdash;and the same area where Joe Hansart disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another prospector?&rdquo; Ken inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe disappeared six or seven years ago. He set
off into the canyons and never came back. It&rsquo;s a bad
locality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warner seemed suddenly to remember his manners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the house,&rdquo; he invited them. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have a spot of coffee and give that map the once-over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 12</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;See that jagged peak with the patch of snow
almost at its tip? Right below is stunted timber
land. Well, that&rsquo;s Crazy Mountain. I figure Headless
Hollow is somewhere in there behind those
tumbles of rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig Warner stood at the cabin window, pointing
toward the distant horizon. Over mugs of strong,
steaming coffee, the Scouts had studied Old Stony&rsquo;s
map with their rancher host. Somewhat to their
surprise, Warner had seemed impressed by the
crudely drawn paper as he compared it with a contour
map of the mountain area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; know,&rdquo; he confessed, his grin boyish, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
always had a hankering to find out what&rsquo;s behind
those barriers. Here I&rsquo;ve lived fairly close to the
place for years, and I never attempted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have a map now,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said.
&ldquo;A motive, shall we say? So perhaps you&rsquo;ll decide
to search for your fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The rancher laughed and shook his head. &ldquo;I know
better than to place faith in tales of hidden gold.
The last great strike in this state was at Cripple
Creek, just behind Pikes Peak. That district had
been passed up for years because prospectors said
it lacked the usual signs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Headless Hollow may be the same,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid not.&rdquo; Warner placed the map in a drawer
of the living-room desk. &ldquo;But the area might offer
uranium possibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has no one ever been there?&rdquo; Ken asked. &ldquo;Recently,
I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folks hereabouts are too busy to risk their necks
on crazy climbs. Besides, as I told you, the area
has a bad reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said something about a prospector disappearing
there,&rdquo; Warwick reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Joe Hansart. He was a strange character&mdash;one
of the real old-timers&mdash;always asking folks
to grubstake him. He&rsquo;d disappear for months at a
time. Always broke when he showed up again. Well,
he became obsessed with the idea there was gold
somewhere on Crazy Mountain. About seven years
ago, I think it was, he packed out of here, heading
that way, and was never seen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he fell off a cliff,&rdquo; Ken observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Headless Hollow locality has plenty of hazards.
Something happened to him, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Could he have stayed on there alone year after
year?&rdquo; Jack asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how, but there&rsquo;s a small lake where
a man could fish, and if he had ammunition he
could provide himself with meat. But the winters
are bitterly cold. No, I don&rsquo;t figure even a tough
old knot like Joe Hansart could have made out.
He must be dead. The question is, how did he die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems to trouble you,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said.
&ldquo;Friend of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never set eyes on Joe except once or twice. It&rsquo;s
the stories about Headless Hollow that bother me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It began years ago,&rdquo; the rancher said, lighting
his pipe. &ldquo;I suppose my father&rsquo;s death and Stony&rsquo;s
disappearance marked the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it known they were supposed to have struck
gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t keep such things completely
dark,&rdquo; Warner replied with a smile. &ldquo;I was a boy at
the time, so all I know is hearsay. At first, feeling
was high against Stony, because people thought he
was responsible for my father&rsquo;s death. My mother
never shared that feeling. She always said the man
was falsely accused&mdash;that it must have been an
accident. But you know how folks are&mdash;they always
want to blame someone. Stony could have cleared
himself, but he ran away, and that made it look
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;You think Stony shot your father by accident?&rdquo;
Ken questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either that, or it was an Indian bullet, as Stony
claimed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do Indians live in the hollow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The area is uninhabited, as far as I know.
Folks deliberately avoid that section of the mountain.
Prospectors who have tried to go there in recent
years&mdash;well, they just seem to have bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re referring to Joe Hansart&rsquo;s disappearance?&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been other things, too,&rdquo; the rancher
admitted reluctantly. &ldquo;A couple of ambitious young
rock climbers thought they would tackle Crazy
Mountain two years ago. One of &rsquo;em had a bad
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That could happen to anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. But this kid claimed someone above him
started an avalanche. No one hereabouts put any
stock in it&mdash;but it did serve to stir up rumors again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rumors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not superstitious, and I know you folks
aren&rsquo;t, either. The tale is that the Spirit of Crazy
Mountain guards the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folks who go there always have trouble?&rdquo; Jack
asked, grinning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. As I said, it&rsquo;s a wild area&mdash;no place for
amateur climbers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd you&rsquo;ve never gone there yourself,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said, eying the rancher thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wanted to,&rdquo; Warner confessed, &ldquo;especially
when I was younger and my legs were in
better condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem in pretty fair shape to me right now,&rdquo;
the Scout leader replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I try to keep fit.&rdquo; Warner abruptly got up
and walked to the window again. Staring toward the
faraway mountains, he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have tried to find
that valley years ago, but I never had the time.
Now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston prodded as the rancher fell
into meditative silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no climb to tackle alone. Frankly, there&rsquo;s
no one hereabouts that I could take with me. Plenty
would be eager to go, but they&rsquo;d be a hindrance,
not a help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know someone who would be tickled to go,&rdquo;
War cut in with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t want to meet him, either,&rdquo; War
laughed.</p>
<p>He then mentioned Jarrett Walz&rsquo; name and told
to what lengths the motel owner had gone to gain
possession of the treasure map.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; Warner exclaimed, impressed.
&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s so keen on getting his hands on this map,
then it must have some value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks so,&rdquo; said Mr. Livingston. &ldquo;I would
advise you to keep that bit of paper in a safe
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no one ever comes here. Not once in a
month,&rdquo; the rancher answered. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my first visitors
since June. It&rsquo;s a real pleasure having you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warner, the Scouts now knew, lived alone, except
for two ranch hands who looked after the stock. He
had no wife or children.</p>
<p>After chatting a while longer, the Scouts started
to leave, but their host would not hear of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay until tomorrow morning at least,&rdquo; he urged.
&ldquo;I like company, if it&rsquo;s the right sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts had enjoyed Craig Warner&rsquo;s companionship,
and his invitation flattered them. When
Mr. Livingston left the decision to them, they voted
to remain.</p>
<p>Warner cooked a hearty lunch for the boys and
showed them around Cloud Crest. Whenever he was
out of doors, they noticed, his steel blue eyes roved
naturally to the distant peaks of Crazy Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; know,&rdquo; he admitted with a self-conscious
laugh, &ldquo;that map has fired my imagination! Not in
years have I felt so excited!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gold fever?&rdquo; Hap Livingston asked with a
chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the rancher answered soberly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more
than that. I&rsquo;ve never seen my father&rsquo;s grave. The tale
of gold interests me, but only incidentally. I want
to see this place you call Headless Hollow, because
its mystery lures me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trip such as that would require careful planning,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would. That&rsquo;s why so many who started for
the region met disaster. Their expeditions were badly
organized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Craig Warner became lost in thought. The
Scouts sensed that he was seriously considering making
practical use of the map they had turned over
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo; know, except for one thing, I&rsquo;d start for Headless
Hollow at the drop of a hat,&rdquo; the rancher suddenly
announced, leaning on the rail fence. &ldquo;I could
get away from here for a week&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that one thing holding you up?&rdquo; Jack
asked curiously, though he thought he could guess
the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know better than to go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you won&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; Jack drawled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>For a minute, the other Scouts were mystified by
his remark. Then, following his gaze, they saw that
a car was coming up the winding dirt road toward
the ranch. It was a rented taxi.</p>
<p>A lone male passenger sat beside the driver. By
this time, the car was close enough for the Scouts
to make out the general outline of the man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The visitor was Jarrett Walz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 13</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THIEF IN THE NIGHT</span></h2>
<p>The rented car rolled up the lane and halted near
the fence where Craig Warner and the Scouts
waited.</p>
<p>Paying off the driver, Jarrett Walz strode over to
the group. He showed no surprise at seeing Mr.
Livingston and the Explorers, nor did he make any
apology for having followed them to the Cloud
Crest Ranch. In fact, he deliberately ignored the
Scouts, addressing Craig Warner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me,&rdquo; he said, offering his hand,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;m Jarrett Walz from Rocking Horse. An old
friend of Stony&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; the rancher responded. His manner was
neither friendly nor unfriendly.</p>
<p>The motel owner then launched into a glorified
account of the manner in which he had befriended
Old Stony. Mr. Livingston and the Scouts let him
run on without interruption.</p>
<p>Finally, Walz wound up his long-winded monologue
by asking Warner if the Explorers had turned
over the Headless Hollow map to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; the rancher replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drove out here to make you a proposition,&rdquo;
Walz rattled on. &ldquo;How about you and me teaming
up for a bit of adventure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re proposing we explore the Headless Hollow
region?&rdquo; said Warner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? It&rsquo;s a good time of year&mdash;everything&rsquo;s
in our favor. Since you have the map we may find
a valuable mine site&mdash;or at least a cache of ore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t team up with a man on an hour&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realize I&rsquo;m a stranger,&rdquo; Walz said, &ldquo;but if you
doubt my character, send a wire to anyone in Rocking
Horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need testimonials to judge a man,&rdquo; Warner
replied dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does the proposal strike you? The quicker
we get started, the better I&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warner did not answer the motel owner&rsquo;s question
directly. Instead, he said, &ldquo;No one has any business
on Crazy Mountain without a good pair of legs. A
trip such as you&rsquo;re proposing would take a heap o&rsquo;
planning. You&rsquo;d need supplies&mdash;a list made out with
care, because every pound you pack counts. Footwear&rsquo;s
important, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mere details. I can buy anything I need in
an hour&rsquo;s time. The essential thing is to have a guide
who knows the country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not find anyone hereabouts that has ever
been to the Headless Hollow region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the place has never been explored?&rdquo;
Walz demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men have gone there,&rdquo; Warner drawled, &ldquo;but
they don&rsquo;t seem to come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remark jarred Walz for a moment. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
trying to scare me out of it!&rdquo; he accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the rancher answered quietly. &ldquo;Just giving
you the facts. I reckon a good mountain climber
who&rsquo;s willing to take punishment could reach the
place, but he&rsquo;d have to face hazards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bears? Cougars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Animals shouldn&rsquo;t give any trouble if a man
minds his business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is holding us back?&rdquo; Walz demanded
impatiently. &ldquo;Are you afraid of the climb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be tricky finding a pass down into the
valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They told me in town you&rsquo;re one of the best
mountaineers in this section&mdash;you and Pete Ranier,
the half-breed Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you talk to Pete?&rdquo; Warner suggested.
&ldquo;He might be induced to take you to the Headless
region&mdash;for a price.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t have the map,&rdquo; Walz growled.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t want to team up with him. Besides,
he&rsquo;s a heavy drinker, they tell me&mdash;reliable
only when he&rsquo;s sober.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to stay here tonight,&rdquo; Warner
said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk some more. Maybe we can get
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; the motel owner responded heartily. &ldquo;I
thought you&rsquo;d see it my way. You team up with me,
and I&rsquo;ll pay all the expenses. If we hit it lucky, we&rsquo;ll
split any way you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts remained out of doors while Warner
showed Walz to a room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if this isn&rsquo;t our cue to pull out of here?&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston remarked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be pleasant,
now that Walz has come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll only try to make us look bad,&rdquo; Jack
agreed.</p>
<p>When Craig Warner came outside alone, the
Scouts mentioned leaving, but he would not hear
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t turn Walz away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As for teaming
up with him, I&rsquo;m not even considering it. Stick
around, boys. Things may get interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whenever the rancher was near, Walz deliberately
avoided the Scouts. Late in the afternoon, however,
he ran into Jack and Ken near the corrals. They
would have passed him without a word, if he had
not blocked their way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been telling Warner things about me that
aren&rsquo;t true!&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>Ken and Jack were amused by the accusation.
It did not seem deserving of a reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get this!&rdquo; Walz snapped. &ldquo;I want that map, and
I mean to get it! I&rsquo;m warning you not to interfere!
If you do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find out!&rdquo; Walz blustered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fed up
with your meddling. Take my advice and drive on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We like the scenery,&rdquo; Jack retorted, &ldquo;so we&rsquo;re
staying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the early chores were done, Warner told
his visitors he would take them over to see Tarta
Lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a little hike,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Figured we could
tote our grub up there and cook supper under the
stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Explorers fell in with the plan at once. Walz
seemed annoyed, but he kept his thoughts to himself.</p>
<p>They set off single file up a gentle slope, Warner
leading the way. He had an easy, fast, smooth stride,
which the Scouts deliberately imitated. Walz kept
up at first, then fell to the end of the line. When
the climb became more difficult&mdash;rocky and steep&mdash;Walz
sat down to empty gravel from his shoes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>&ldquo;How much farther?&rdquo; he puffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than a mile,&rdquo; the rancher replied.</p>
<p>The Scouts were all in good condition, and therefore
the sharp climb was no test for their sturdy,
muscular legs. Even War, who tired more easily
than his older crew mates, found his breath holding.</p>
<p>At Tarta Lake Walz collapsed on the grass. He
rested while Warner and the Scouts built a fire and
set steaks to broiling.</p>
<p>The mountains had brought peace and relaxation
to the Explorers. Even their irritation at Walz faded
away as they gathered about the glowing log for
an hour of rest and talk.</p>
<p>Warner, usually quiet, related a variety of stories
about the area. Purposely, however, he avoided mention
of Headless Hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer about mountains,&rdquo; he said, watching
sparks fly up from the fire. &ldquo;They have a way of
showing a man for what he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walz eyed him suspiciously but made no comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Soon it was time to start back to the ranch. Warner
made certain every spark of the fire was out, and
they began the long trek. Obviously very tired,
Walz dragged at the end of the line. Warner slowed
his pace, but even so the motel owner could not keep
up. Once he stumbled against a tree and gave it a
savage kick.</p>
<p>Finally, when they were at the ranch once more,
the motel owner collapsed on the davenport with a
little moan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mite out of condition,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;A
couple of days on the trail, and my muscles will be
okay again. Most of my trouble today came from
having the wrong kind of shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mountain can give a fellow quite a beating,&rdquo;
was Warner&rsquo;s only comment.</p>
<p>After an hour of rest, Walz regained his strength.
With reviving zest for the Headless Hollow adventure,
he began to press Warner for a decision.</p>
<p>The rancher regarded him in surprise. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
the mountains given you your answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That jaunt we took was no fair test! Once I get
better equipment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Headless Valley is no place for an amateur,&rdquo;
Warner told him. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re dead set on going there,
Pete Ranier might take you. I doubt it, though. You&rsquo;d
be asking for trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least show me the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rancher hesitated. Then, apparently deciding
his guest could make no practical use of it, he unlocked
the paper from the desk drawer. Eagerly,
Walz pored over it, his dark eyes sparkling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me make a copy of this!&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Warner had begun to regret even showing the
paper to the motel owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Taking the map from Walz, he relocked it in the
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walz,&rdquo; the rancher said, eying him steadily, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t seem to understand what I&rsquo;ve told you about
the Headless Hollow region. It&rsquo;s a dangerous spot
for any man, even if he&rsquo;s at home in the mountains.
You&rsquo;d be a fool to attempt it, even with a
guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says I&rsquo;m going to?&rdquo; Walz retorted.</p>
<p>With a shrug, he bade the group goodnight and
went to the room assigned to him.</p>
<p>The Scouts soon retired, for the long hike and the
fresh mountain air had made everyone very tired.
They slept soundly, hearing nothing until Mr. Livingston
pounded on their bedroom doors the next
morning.</p>
<p>Ken and Jack were the first to get dressed and
down to the kitchen. Warner was there ahead of
them, frying bacon and expertly tossing flapjacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; he greeted the pair cheerfully. &ldquo;Sleep
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like logs,&rdquo; Jack answered. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Walz this
morning? Still worn out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; the rancher drawled. &ldquo;Our
friend is no longer with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left during the night?&rdquo; Jack asked in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon so. Brace yourselves, boys. Your car is
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Scouts accepted this news in stunned silence,
Warner added: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all. Our impulsive
friend likewise has stolen the map!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 14</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">GHOST TOWN</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;The car gone?&rdquo; Jack echoed the rancher&rsquo;s words.
&ldquo;And the map too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did it happen?&rdquo; Ken asked.</p>
<p>Craig Warner flipped another pancake, adding it
to the stack he had baked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Some time during the night. I discovered
the desk broken into when I came downstairs
about twenty minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our car&rsquo;s gone, we&rsquo;re stranded,&rdquo; Jack said
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already telephoned the sheriff. Don&rsquo;t let it
upset you. I figure Warner probably won&rsquo;t go far.
He has only one objective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Headless Hollow,&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he can&rsquo;t drive the car up Crazy Mountain,&rdquo;
the rancher added dryly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll catch up with him.
After breakfast, I&rsquo;ll drive you to Elks Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warner&rsquo;s casual view of the situation only partly
reassured the Scouts. Jack and Ken went at once
to impart the bad news to the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;So Walz really is a crook!&rdquo; Warwick burst out
angrily.</p>
<p>It was impossible to determine how long Walz
had been away from the ranch. However, Willie
recalled that an hour or two before dawn he had
heard an automobile motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so sleepy I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention!&rdquo;
he reproved himself. &ldquo;Chump!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Explorers tried not to talk too much about the
loss of their car, but of course it worried them. They
were hundreds of miles from Belton City, and their
money had run low. They knew they could wire
their parents for more, but they had no intention
of doing so except in an absolute emergency.</p>
<p>As they ate breakfast, Craig Warner seemed in as
good spirits as ever. The loss of the map didn&rsquo;t
appear to disturb him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can draw it myself from memory,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;That paper won&rsquo;t be nearly the help to Walz he
thinks it will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your guess is he&rsquo;ll head straight for the mountain?&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston asked.</p>
<p>The rancher nodded as he refilled the coffee cups.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tackle it if he can get anyone to go with him.
Pete Ranier might be crazy enough to do it&mdash;for a
price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he a reliable guide?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;One of the best, when he&rsquo;s sober&mdash;and that isn&rsquo;t
often. But he has a fiery temper. He and our friend
Walz would be sure to tangle. Ranier can&rsquo;t stand
a tenderfoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts ate rapidly, impatient to be off in pursuit
of Walz. Their host, on the other hand, was
deliberate. Certainly he seemed in no hurry to drive
them to town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practically all our stuff is in that car,&rdquo; Willie
muttered to Jack as they stood in the yard, waiting
for the rancher to start his motor in the barn.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he give a darn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warner backed out the car and then went into
the house again. When he returned, he was grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news, boys!&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;The sheriff&rsquo;s
found your car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Jack demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abandoned at Elks Creek. I figured Warner
wouldn&rsquo;t take it very far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about our stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Warner&rsquo;s car was old, it was durable. The
Explorers all piled in, and the drive to Elks Creek
was made in fast time. They found Mr. Livingston&rsquo;s
sedan on a side street near a gas station. One of
the tires was flat, but otherwise the car seemed not
to have been damaged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Quickly the Scouts checked their luggage. A
sleeping bag was missing, as well as one of the pup
tents and a set of nested pans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least Walz took only what he figured he&rsquo;d
need,&rdquo; Ken said in disgust.</p>
<p>Inquiry established that Walz had been seen
going to Ranier&rsquo;s shack shortly after dawn.</p>
<p>Apparently the two had come to an agreement,
for they had bought supplies and started off in the
guide&rsquo;s old car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re heading for Crazy Mountain,&rdquo; Warner
decided. &ldquo;Ranier should have better sense than to
start off with a fellow like Walz. He probably figures
Walz will buckle up after a day on the trail and
call the deal off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be stubborn enough to keep on and
get into real trouble,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said soberly.
&ldquo;He has the gold fever pretty bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting it myself,&rdquo; the rancher confessed
with a chuckle. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll sling together an outfit
and pack after him. I&rsquo;d like to get that map back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you head for Headless Hollow alone?&rdquo;
the Scout leader asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I can get you and your boys to come
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts regarded the rancher in surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will be no trick to pick up Walz&rsquo; trail,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;With luck we can overtake him by tomorrow. When
we do, we&rsquo;ll teach our friend a little lesson in manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An expedition, even a short distance into the
mountains, was not to be undertaken lightly, and
Mr. Livingston had no great enthusiasm for the
venture. Nevertheless, he agreed with the Scouts
that Walz ought to be brought to justice and forced
to pay for the articles he had stolen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; War urged eagerly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t we owe it
to Stony to see that Walz never gets his hands on
any gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see you&rsquo;re all for the trip,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said. &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t this a job for the sheriff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; Warner agreed, &ldquo;but getting the sheriff
to tackle Crazy Mountain is another proposition.
He&rsquo;ll never do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole matter was debated thoroughly, and
in the end the Scout leader was persuaded by the
Explorers to give his consent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what will develop if we do overtake Walz
worries me,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston admitted. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
take the law into our own hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that part to me,&rdquo; Warner said grimly. &ldquo;I
know how to handle men of his stripe. We&rsquo;ll bring
him back and turn him over to the authorities.
Sheriff Brown will deputize me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>It was believed that Walz and his guide could
be overtaken speedily but, to prepare for any possible
emergency, the group decided to pack enough
supplies for several days on the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walz will never reach the Headless Hollow Valley,&rdquo;
the rancher predicted confidently. &ldquo;Alone,
Ranier might do it. But if I know him, he&rsquo;s in this
expedition only for a bit of quick cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the need for haste, Craig Warner and Mr.
Livingston were very thorough in their planning.
Warner bought the supplies, including a vial of
saccharin for sugar because of its lightness, some
powdered milk, flour mix, oatmeal, dried fruit, salt,
tea, and coffee. He also added a first-aid kit, a fishing
rod, and a revolver borrowed from a friend when
Sheriff Brown made him a deputy.</p>
<p>One of Warner&rsquo;s ranch hands drove the party to
Buckhorn and on to the beginning of the mountain
road. There the six climbers shouldered heavy packs
and trudged upward, at first following a marked trail.
After a while, the trail played out, and the going
became harder.</p>
<p>Making only brief stops for rest, they climbed
steadily, through ravines and steep-walled canyons.
At intervals, Warner raked the distant rock shelves
with his field glass, but he failed to sight the two
men he believed to have gone on ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>The day was cloudless, and a warm sun blazed
down. Laboring under the heavy packs, the Scouts
perspired profusely. Their leg muscles, tough as
they were, began to ache. No one, however, made
complaint or suggested a slower pace. When they
paused to drink at a spring and refill canteens, Warner
consulted the rough map he had redrawn from
memory and compared it with an accurate contour
map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only fair to warn you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the climb
so far is only a tiny taste of what&rsquo;s ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a pencil, he made a dotted line, showing
their projected route over the top of the mountain
and down to an isolated valley. Then the line went
up again into the higher, desolate peaks of Crazy
Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our problem&mdash;if we follow Walz that far,&rdquo; the
rancher said, frowning thoughtfully, &ldquo;is to find a
pass through to the Headless Hollow region. It may
not be easy. So if anyone wants to turn back, now&rsquo;s
the time to say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One and all, the Scouts shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Warner said, well pleased. &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s hit
the trail. No time is to be lost if we&rsquo;re going to overtake
Walz.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>For hours, the party trudged on. They passed
the water line into an area where the trees were
twisted into grotesque shapes before they thinned
out to only occasional trunks. Higher up, timber
disappeared entirely. The air became light and
chilly.</p>
<p>War and Willie were hard pressed to keep up
with the others. Despite their fatigue, Warner had
to keep on, for it was growing late and the area
offered no suitable camp site.</p>
<p>On the other slope of the mountain the descent
was easier, but by the time the rancher finally called
a halt on a rock shelf above a racing stream, everyone
was worn out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you figure Walz has managed to come
this far?&rdquo; Willie muttered, dropping his pack. &ldquo;I
never thought he had it in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ve lost him,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
not seen a trace of him or his guide since we left
Elks Creek this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the others busied themselves making camp,
Jack and Warner scanned the ravines and mountainside
with the powerful field glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See any smoke?&rdquo; the rancher asked.</p>
<p>Jack lowered the glass. &ldquo;No trace of a camp. But
I thought you said this was uninhabited country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite. A town is hidden down there on the
slope. I can see buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>The rancher smiled broadly. &ldquo;Any people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Jack studied the distant cluster of buildings
through the glass. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; he acknowledged.
&ldquo;The place looks lifeless. Dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking at a ghost town, Jack. No one has
lived there for thirty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. The town flourished in the old gold
days&mdash;then was deserted. It&rsquo;s cut off from roads
and railroads. All supplies had to be packed in. So
when the gold bubble blew up, miners pulled out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the town has an occupant now,&rdquo; Jack announced,
a trace of excitement in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walz?&rdquo; the rancher demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>Jack shook his head, offering the glass to Warner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Walz. His guide, perhaps. I saw a fellow
with long white hair and a beard. I caught a
glimpse of him before he went into one of the buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warner gazed oddly at Jack as he began to adjust
the powerful glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ranier,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t have a beard, or
white hair either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 15</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">WARM ASHES</span></h2>
<p>For some minutes, Craig Warner studied the ghost
town below the Scout camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anyone,&rdquo; he told Jack. &ldquo;Sure you saw
a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he had a white beard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought so,&rdquo; Jack replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting
dark, though. I suppose I could have been mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been Walz,&rdquo; the rancher decided,
lowering the field glass.</p>
<p>That night, there was little talk over the camp
fire. The Scouts were tired, especially Warwick and
Willie, and everyone turned in the minute the work
was done.</p>
<p>They used fir boughs for beds, but even so the
hard rock shelf was so uncomfortable that Jack slept
fitfully. His legs hurt from the long, hard climb. His
back ached, too. No matter how he adjusted himself,
the cold night air seemed to hit him. He could hear
Willie and War moaning and tossing not far away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Of the Explorers, only Ken appeared to be getting a
sound night&rsquo;s sleep.</p>
<p>Jack was up at dawn, ready to help Craig Warner
build the fire and start breakfast. Cups of strong
black coffee, oatmeal, and pancakes made everyone
feel better and revived zest for the adventure.</p>
<p>While the Scouts fixed their packs, Mr. Livingston
and the rancher carefully went over the contour
map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll swing down to the old ghost town,&rdquo; Warner
decided. &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have a hard climb to the pass
which leads into the Headless Hollow area. We may
not be lucky enough to find a way through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where Walz has the advantage of us,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston replied. &ldquo;The map he has probably
shows the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the Scouts had caught no glimpse of Walz
and his guide, they had begun to wonder if they
were following a phantom trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to catch up with Walz,&rdquo; the rancher said.
&ldquo;I sure would. But if we miss him, it may save us a
lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case, you&rsquo;ll push on to the Hollow?&rdquo; Ken
asked hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to. Since we&rsquo;ve come this far, we may as
well have a look at that valley. This may be our
only chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The decision pleased the Scouts. Tired though
they were, the hard climb was a challenge. Besides,
they felt they never would be satisfied until they
learned whether or not Old Stony&rsquo;s tale of the valley
was true.</p>
<p>With the distant ghost town as the immediate
objective, the party soon started the sharp descent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep close together, boys,&rdquo; Warner warned. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t want to start any rock slides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The footing was slippery. Twice War, who had
not balanced his horseshoe pack well that morning,
stumbled and would have fallen if Jack had not
seized his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful,&rdquo; the rancher warned again. &ldquo;A broken
leg or even a sprained ankle could be a serious
matter, now that we&rsquo;re so far from help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they continued, Jack saw the rancher glance
frequently at the younger boys. War was a fairly
new member of the Explorers and not so well
seasoned as the others to withstand hardships. Jack
himself wondered if War would be able to hold out.</p>
<p>At noon, the party stopped briefly by a stream, to
drink and refill canteens. While the others rested,
Warner whipped the pools with his fly rod and
brought in four handsome trout for the meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>The halt refreshed War only for a while. Soon
it was apparent that he was beginning to falter.
Warner, who was leading, slowed his pace but, even
so, both War and Willie trailed.</p>
<p>It was a relief when finally, hours later, the party
trudged into the old ghost town which had been
built hard against the shadowy mountainside. The
silence of the place was almost oppressive.</p>
<p>Dropping his pack, Jack stared at the unpainted
wooden buildings which had fallen into decay. The
two that were made of stone and brick were in
somewhat better condition. The row of old, deserted
cabins gave him an eerie, uneasy feeling. He wandered
into one of the musty buildings.</p>
<p>Suddenly he heard Ken call. Stepping outside, he
saw his friend in the doorway of the best-preserved
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; Ken urged.</p>
<p>Jack went quickly across the empty, dusty street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no ghost town,&rdquo; Ken said in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo; you mean, Ken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken led inside to the stone-and-clay fireplace
where ashes lay deep on the hearth. Beside the
fireplace was a pile of neatly stacked wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel those ashes,&rdquo; Ken directed.</p>
<p>There was no need for Jack to do so for, when he
stirred them with the toe of his boot, they gave off
a thread of smoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been here!&rdquo; Ken announced. &ldquo;In the
last few hours, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I was right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night I was sure I saw someone through
the field glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did to Craig Warner. He thought I was mistaken,
or that perhaps it was Walz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone had a fire here in the last few hours,&rdquo;
Ken said reflectively. &ldquo;Did you see smoke rising?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was Walz with his guide,&rdquo; Ken decided,
frowning. &ldquo;Probably they camped here last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Walz,&rdquo; Jack insisted. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t think
the fellow I saw through the field glass was his guide,
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stony&rsquo;s ghost maybe,&rdquo; Jack said, chuckling. Then
he sobered. &ldquo;Guess we should warn the fellows.
Someone might be prowling around here even now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you&rsquo;re suggesting is sort of fantastic,&rdquo; Ken
protested. &ldquo;This ghost town is out of the way. Why
would anyone except Walz come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe word has leaked out about Stony&rsquo;s cache
of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever it is, he&rsquo;s been here for quite a while,
Jack. Not just overnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His gaze sharpened by Ken&rsquo;s remark, Jack made
a more minute inspection of the room. He saw a
pile of empty tin cans, a clear indication that someone
had eaten many meals here. Match stubs were
scattered on the floor. The rotted boards, too, had
been tracked heavily with mud, that was now dry.</p>
<p>Disturbed by their discovery, Ken and Jack went
to warn the others. By this time, however, the Scouts
had wandered through every building in the little
town without seeing anyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anyone was here, he&rsquo;s gone now,&rdquo; Willie remarked,
unworried.</p>
<p>Mr. Warner was inclined to think a prospector
searching for uranium might have chanced that way.
He seemed untroubled, so Jack and Ken decided
they probably were making too much of the matter.
No more was said.</p>
<p>Of far more concern was War&rsquo;s state of weariness.
Though he made no complaint and stubbornly insisted
he felt able to go on, everyone could see that
his strength had been overtaxed. After a quiet talk,
Mr. Livingston and the rancher decided to make
camp at the ghost town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re stopping because of me,&rdquo; War protested.
&ldquo;I can make it okay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all tired,&rdquo; Warner told him. &ldquo;From here on,
the climb will be rugged. No use killing ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel fine by morning,&rdquo; War declared, plainly
relieved that the party would not press on at once.
&ldquo;All I need is a good night&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preferring to sleep under the stars, the Scouts
set their camp in a sheltered spot at the edge of
the empty little village. That night, around the camp
fire Warner told the boys of the old Colorado boom
days when mining towns had flourished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly all of the old camps have shriveled and
fallen into decay,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some have become
tourist attractions. Not this place, because it is
inaccessible except to a hardy climber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>War was the first to turn in for the night, and
the others prepared to follow. Jack stood a moment,
staring up at the jagged mountain peaks. Their way
on the morrow lay amid a tumbled mass of rocks
and pinnacles, with ridges running in several directions.
Would Warner be able to find the pass?</p>
<p>Unnoticed, Mr. Livingston came up behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A penny for your thoughts, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re worth less. I was thinking we&rsquo;re in for
a real test tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; the Scout leader agreed, &ldquo;and, frankly,
I&rsquo;m worried about War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His condition?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He has determination and nerve, but he&rsquo;s
not up to a trip as hard as this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing except make it as easy as we can for him.
Warner and I will lighten his pack tomorrow. We
can&rsquo;t cache any of the food, because we&rsquo;re likely
to run short as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the mountainside the night was bitterly cold.
Nevertheless, everyone slept soundly until dawn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 16</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">MISSING SUPPLIES</span></h2>
<p>Warner, the first one up, started the fire going and
began mixing pan bread. Jack cut more wood and
then went to get supplies from his pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, who took my stuff?&rdquo; he demanded loudly.</p>
<p>The pack was not hanging where he had left it
the previous night. While he searched, Willie let
out a yip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, the food I carried is gone too!&rdquo; he yelled.
&ldquo;All the tea, the flour, and our raisins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grimly, Mr. Livingston and the rancher joined
in the search. Very quickly they realized it was a
waste of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone sneaked up here during the night and
went off with the stuff!&rdquo; Jack said angrily.</p>
<p>The loss of so much food was a serious matter.
Carefully, the Scouts searched every building in
the old ghost town. They came upon no one. However,
as they went from cabin to cabin, they experienced
a strange, uneasy feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if someone is watching us,&rdquo; Jack muttered,
expressing the thoughts of the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>Back at camp, Warner rounded up everyone for
a conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loss of our food is serious,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have
some left, but not enough to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts regarded him with sober faces. Until
this moment, they had not realized how much it
meant to them to attain their goal&mdash;Headless Hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the verdict?&rdquo; Jack asked, after a long
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to say this, boys,&rdquo; the rancher replied.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re up against it. There&rsquo;s nothing we can do
but turn back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack poked at the rocks with a stick, thinking
over the rancher&rsquo;s decision. He knew it was a wise
one. So did all the Scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; Warner said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a fast
check of our supplies. If we don&rsquo;t have any further
bad luck, there&rsquo;s barely enough food to get us to
Headless Valley, with nothing for the return trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish,&rdquo; Willie said hopefully. &ldquo;We could cut our
rations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t help much. We&rsquo;ve made slower
time than I figured. Naturally, we&rsquo;ve consumed more
food, and we were short enough even without this
theft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you figure did it?&rdquo; Jack speculated. &ldquo;Not
Walz?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt Walz got this far. If he headed for
the hollow as we assumed, he may have gone by
a different route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow I saw through the field glass may
have done it,&rdquo; Jack pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be,&rdquo; Warner agreed. &ldquo;I thought you were
wrong night before last when you said you saw
someone, but it seems I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stealing a man&rsquo;s food is serious business,&rdquo; Mr.
Livingston remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; the rancher agreed. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t the fellow&mdash;whoever
he was&mdash;come forward and ask for what
he needed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he now? That&rsquo;s what I want to know,&rdquo;
Willie grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably hiding out somewhere in the rocks and
trees,&rdquo; Warner replied. &ldquo;For that matter, if he&rsquo;s
unfriendly, he could take a pot shot at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You assume he&rsquo;s armed?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Warner hesitated and then added:
&ldquo;Along with the food, he took my gun. I thought I
wouldn&rsquo;t worry you by saying anything about it,
but reckon I should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This additional bad news hit the Scouts hard.
It was War who broke the gloomy silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a drag,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t try
to feed me any soft soap. This is my point: suppose
I turn back? Wouldn&rsquo;t you have enough grub for
the rest of the party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be shaving it too close,&rdquo; Warner replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe if two of us went back&mdash;?&rdquo; suggested
Willie slowly. &ldquo;For instance, War and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even at that, I doubt we could make it,&rdquo; Warner
said after a moment&rsquo;s thought. &ldquo;Thanks, boys, for
offering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a forest ranger&rsquo;s station near Elks Creek?&rdquo;
Jack asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Warner told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the service have patrol planes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. They&rsquo;re stationed about fifteen miles from
Elks Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Headless Hollow area has a lake,&rdquo; Jack
reminded the group. &ldquo;Do you suppose it would be
possible to get the rangers to fly over that lake and
drop a supply of food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, you have a brain!&rdquo; Ken exclaimed. &ldquo;Only
how do we get word to the rangers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That part&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; Willie said quietly. &ldquo;War and
I will carry the message.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>The unselfishness of the two Scouts drew everyone&rsquo;s
admiration. Jack and Ken insisted that if anyone
turned back, they would be the ones to do it.
But in this they were overruled by both Mr. Livingston
and the rancher.</p>
<p>After a thorough discussion, Willie&rsquo;s plan prevailed.
Accordingly, he and War took light packs
with just enough food and bedding to see them
safely back to Elks Creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a plane speeding to Headless Hollow
in a couple of days,&rdquo; Willie promised. &ldquo;But if it
should be a little longer, don&rsquo;t worry. We&rsquo;ll get it
there somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the return trip slowly,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
urged them.</p>
<p>He offered to go with them, but they would not
hear of it. War insisted that he felt strong again
after his night&rsquo;s rest and could make the return
journey without difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better this way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I took a
look at that mountain last night, I knew I never
could make it to the pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just be sure you bring back some gold,&rdquo; Willie
said with a grin, as the Scouts bade him good-by.
&ldquo;And keep your eyes peeled for trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two trudged off, turning once to wave. Shouldering
their packs, the others then started on the
long climb in the opposite direction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>The sun glistened brightly on the high peaks.
Jack tried to distinguish the two sentinel rocks which
Old Stony had led them to believe guarded the
entrance into the valley. However, all the peaks
looked alike to him.</p>
<p>Warner had not exaggerated in warning that the
climb would be hard. After two hours of it, the
Scouts welcomed a rest. Jack dropped his bedroll
and stretched out flat on his back.</p>
<p>Shading his eyes against the glare of the sun, he
let his gaze wander over the distant peaks again.
For just an instant, he thought he saw the flash of
color against granite rock. Getting quickly to his feet,
he asked Warner for his field glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; Ken demanded as Jack trained
it on the rocks far above them. &ldquo;The old man with
whiskers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Jack reported, crestfallen. &ldquo;Thought
for a minute it was someone&rsquo;s red shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re seeing things for sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess so,&rdquo; Jack conceded with a grin. He returned
the glass to its case and flopped on the
ground once more.</p>
<p>After a twenty-minute rest, the party started on.</p>
<p>The way became increasingly difficult and the
footing insecure. Once Jack dislodged a small rock
and it clattered down the mountainside hundreds of
feet. Canyons bore the scars of sizable slides. Warner
told the Scouts that in winter avalanches were a great
hazard in this area&mdash;that even a small rock slide
could be very dangerous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Lunch was frugal. Mr. Livingston boiled water
for tea, but in the high altitude it took a long while.
The Scouts satisfied themselves with crackers and
cheese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always wise to eat lightly when you&rsquo;re climbing,&rdquo;
Jack said with a grin.</p>
<p>For another hour, they fought their way upward
through the tumbled rocks. It was Warner&rsquo;s hope
that they could find the pass and before nightfall
descend to a good camp site in the valley.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 17</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AVALANCHE</span></h2>
<p>The party worked itself on up toward the summit,
climbing doggedly, single file&mdash;when suddenly a
strange noise was heard.</p>
<p>Warner, in the lead, looked up quickly. A giant
boulder was hurtling down the steep mountainside,
taking all before it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand where you are!&rdquo; he shouted hoarsely.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the great boulder bounded down the mountainside
toward the Scouts, they stood frozen. It was
impossible to guess the exact course the big stone
would take, for it was careening wildly.</p>
<p>To run when the footing was so treacherous would
have been far more dangerous than to remain where
they were. Craig Warner, an experienced mountaineer,
had made his split-second decision and his
shout of warning had been instantly obeyed by the
Explorers. However, to remain motionless as the
massive rock raced toward them required almost
more willpower than they could command.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>The crisis came quickly. The huge boulder, showering
loose rock in all directions, loomed above
the boys. Then as quickly as the danger had come,
it was over. With the speed of an express train, the
rock swept past them. By scant inches it missed Ken,
setting up a breeze as it rushed by.</p>
<p>On rolled the big rock to crash hundreds of feet
below in a tangle of twisted pines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! That was close!&rdquo; Ken exclaimed when he
had recovered speech.</p>
<p>Jack, breathing hard, asked shakily, &ldquo;What started
that rock rolling down the mountain? An animal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A two-legged one, I suspect,&rdquo; rejoined Warner,
his voice tight.</p>
<p>He adjusted his field glass to train it on the rocks
high above them.</p>
<p>Lowering it after several minutes, he said: &ldquo;No
question about it. That rock was dislodged purposely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo; Jack demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I glimpsed the fellow only for an instant when
I first saw the rock coming our way. Then he ducked
back out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Walz?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, but I couldn&rsquo;t be sure,&rdquo; the
rancher returned, squinting thoughtfully into the
sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s that same bird who stole our food,&rdquo;
Jack speculated. &ldquo;For an unpopulated mountain,
this place seems to have quite a bit of activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; Warner tersely agreed.</p>
<p>The near disaster had slightly unnerved everyone.
Both Mr. Livingston and Craig Warner were puzzled,
for the rancher said again that he knew of no
prospector who frequented Crazy Mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would anyone want to prevent us from
reaching the pass?&rdquo; he speculated. &ldquo;Walz would
have a reason, but I doubt he ever got this far. Even
with Ranier he certainly couldn&rsquo;t have made it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone else may know about the cache of
gold,&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It begins to look that way,&rdquo; Warner agreed.
&ldquo;Either that, or we&rsquo;re dealing with a screwball. If
a man lives too long alone&mdash;well, sometimes his mind
becomes twisted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a brief rest, the party struggled on, the
mystery unsolved. Warner used exceeding caution,
keeping almost constant watch of the ledges above.
But he didn&rsquo;t get a glimpse of anyone.</p>
<p>Climbing was slow work, and the Scouts were
hampered by the necessity for keeping constantly
alert for further trouble from above. A misstep
could have meant a bad fall because below were
enormous cliffs and breath-taking drops.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;With luck, we should soon reach the pass,&rdquo; Warner
advised the group. &ldquo;Our contour map doesn&rsquo;t
show it, so I&rsquo;m depending entirely on that memory
sketch I made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t sighted those two twin peaks Old
Stony told us about,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what bothers me,&rdquo; Warner replied. &ldquo;In
taking his landmarks, maybe he made them on the
return trip from Headless Hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; exclaimed Ken, startled. &ldquo;In that case,
everything would be different from the way we&rsquo;re
seeing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, Old Stony may have drawn his
map purposely wrong to throw off anyone who
might steal it,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston reminded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know,&rdquo; Warner replied.</p>
<p>Settling themselves to a hard, relentless grind of
climbing, the Scouts followed their guide with
dogged determination. Progress now was painfully
slow. An hour was required to make a few hundred
feet.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s back had grown numb from the weight of
the pack. His legs felt as if they would buckle beneath
him. Mr. Livingston likewise was showing
signs of fatigue, and so was Ken. Only their guide
seemed utterly tireless. But as the overcast sun
began to lower behind the jagged peaks, even
Warner began to falter and show signs of strain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>His growing uneasiness began to be felt by the
others. In the last few hours, they had caught no
glimpse of the mysterious enemy believed to have
dislodged the rock. In fact, they had half forgotten
the incident. But a greater worry now confronted
them.</p>
<p>Night was coming on, and unless the pass soon
materialized, they must make camp. However, the
narrow ledges provided little more than walking
space. At times the grades were fairly gentle, giving
the party a little breathing spell. Then again they
became so steep it was hard to find good footing.</p>
<p>Warner and Mr. Livingston pushed desperately
on, hoping to find the pass before darkness crept
upon the lonely mountain. Though they gave no
verbal hint of their growing concern, Ken and Jack
could tell by the grim way the two men climbed
that they were worried.</p>
<p>To add to the party&rsquo;s mounting alarm, the sky
was rapidly becoming veiled with black clouds that
clung around the mountain peaks, ugly and threatening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have rain pretty soon,&rdquo; Ken predicted, as
he and Jack halted to drop their packs briefly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
all we need to make this day complete!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was too weary to answer. But, scanning the
darkening sky, he nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>The day&rsquo;s climb had been unbelievably hard, and
seemingly it was endless. How much longer, he
wondered, would he be able to keep going? He was
glad Willie and War were safely on their way back
to Elks Creek&mdash;at least he hoped they were safe and
comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pass shouldn&rsquo;t be much farther off,&rdquo; Warner
said to encourage the Scouts. &ldquo;We ought to come
to it within another half hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A half hour,&rdquo; Ken repeated. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get the
agony finished as fast as we can!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 18</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DEAD END</span></h2>
<p>The party wormed its way up Crazy Mountain,
gingerly testing the crumbling rock lest it give beneath
their feet. Tortuously, they made another five
hundred feet. Then Warner, who was in the lead,
halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re in a pocket.
This can&rsquo;t be the way to the pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; he directed them. &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve
come to a dead end. If I can get up to that next
ledge, maybe I can see a way on, but I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling along the wall, he secured a firm hand
grip and, with Mr. Livingston&rsquo;s help from below,
attained the ledge above. He crept along it and
vanished from view. For a long while the Scouts
waited, uneasily watching the darkening mountains.
Their situation, they knew, was rapidly becoming
precarious.</p>
<p>Finally, Craig Warner reappeared and lowered
himself back onto the narrow ledge where the Scouts
waited. His face told the story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;No chance of going on?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo; Warner nursed his bruised hands. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
at an absolute dead end. We&rsquo;ve reached a cul-de-sac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words fell like a shroud upon the weary, footsore
group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t camp here,&rdquo; Jack said at last. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll
we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one course open to us. We&rsquo;ll have
to return the way we came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Return?&rdquo; Ken echoed flatly. &ldquo;Not all the way
back to the ghost town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe half that distance,&rdquo; Warner advised.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no water here or fuel. Not even a place to
pitch a tent. Temporarily at least, Crazy Mountain
has licked us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Completely disheartened, everyone sat down on
the rocky ledge to discuss the situation.</p>
<p>Night was fast coming on. A descent along the
narrow trail would at best be a risky undertaking,
but to remain where they were was out of the
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no possibility of going on?&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
asked the rancher. &ldquo;None whatsoever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warner shook his head. &ldquo;The ledge above us
plays out entirely, and the one beyond can&rsquo;t be
reached. We&rsquo;re in a pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to accept the situation,&rdquo; the
Scout leader said, getting wearily to his feet. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearing exhaustion as they were, it seemed to
Ken and Jack that they could not trudge another
mile. But they forced themselves to follow Warner.
Knowing that their safety depended upon reaching
the wider ledges before darkness completely enveloped
the mountain, he took them at a brutal
pace.</p>
<p>The Scouts were discouraged, footsore, and desperately
hungry. Their only sustenance since noon
had been a small piece of chocolate which had provided
a little quick energy.</p>
<p>In less than an hour, darkness closed in. To add
to their troubles, it began to rain. The fall was not
hard, but it came steadily. Soon the Scouts were
chilled through.</p>
<p>It seemed to Jack and Ken they never could make
it. Every step had become an agony. Minds and
bodies had become half paralyzed. Yet automatically
their feet kept plodding on.</p>
<p>Warner seemed to have an instinct for making
his way, even in the dark and rain. His flashlight
guided them at the dangerous turns.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Then gradually their route became easier, the
slope more gradual. They reached a shelf and a little
wooded area beside a fast-rushing stream. It was
not the best camp site, but by this time none of
them was too particular.</p>
<p>Dropping their packs, the Scouts went in search
of firewood. Jack found dry kindling material inside
a log. Ken, after hard chopping, gathered enough
wood to get a little blaze going. By that time, Mr.
Livingston had the pup tents up.</p>
<p>Everyone huddled near the fire, waiting for tea
water to boil. Some of their misery began to
fade.</p>
<p>The rain had practically ceased. The air, however,
was damp, and a mist shrouded everything.</p>
<p>Little by little, the Scouts began to dry out and
relax. Hot tea revived their spirits. By the time
Warner had prepared oatmeal and bacon, they were
feeling almost normal again. But no one spoke of
plans for the next day.</p>
<p>After the simple meal the Explorers chopped more
wood. Then they rolled into their beds and slept
soundly.</p>
<p>By morning, the unpleasant experience on Crazy
Mountain was only a dim memory. Ken and Jack,
even Mr. Livingston, awoke feeling only a little
tired and muscle sore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Once they were astir, most of their aches disappeared.
The day was bright and sunny. Warner had
risen early to whip the eddies for a few trout and
these were cleaned and in the pan, delicately browning
for breakfast.</p>
<p>Over the food, the group discussed procedure.
A full day had been lost in the futile search for the
pass. There was no assurance that, if they went on,
it ever would be found before their skimpy food
supply became exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking over the map again this morning,&rdquo;
Warner said, spreading it on the rocks. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
another way up, and it may lead us through&mdash;that
is, if you&rsquo;re game to tackle it. I&rsquo;m leaving the decision
to you fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken glanced first at Mr. Livingston and then at
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that mess of trout, I could tackle anything,&rdquo;
Jack declared. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are my sentiments,&rdquo; Ken echoed. &ldquo;No
mountain is going to lick me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may run into another cul-de-sac,&rdquo; the rancher
warned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a chance we have to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breaking camp, the party set off once more. This
time, they chose a way which at first was more difficult
than the one they had taken the previous day.
Nevertheless, as the day wore on, they became
hopeful it might lead them to their objective.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer we&rsquo;ve seen nothing of Walz or Ranier,&rdquo;
Jack remarked as the group paused to catch breath
after a particularly steep stretch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may run into them yet,&rdquo; Warner said. &ldquo;With
Old Stony&rsquo;s map, they had a better chance than we
of reaching the pass without trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the party climbed higher, a sharp wind whistled
eerily around the crags. At times, Jack imagined
he heard hollow laughter, as if the spirit of Crazy
Mountain were chortling at some secret joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This place gives me a queer feeling,&rdquo; he confessed
to Ken. &ldquo;Ever since we left the ghost town, I
keep thinking we&rsquo;re being watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken did not laugh as Jack had expected him to
do. Instead, he said: &ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;ve been having
that same feeling. I figure it&rsquo;s because our stuff was
stolen, and then someone shoved that rock down
on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could have been an accident&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but Warner isn&rsquo;t the kind to make a mistake
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s levelheaded,&rdquo; Jack returned soberly. &ldquo;I
figure if we do find that pass today&mdash;well, we may
run into rugged going beyond that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think someone besides Walz wants to keep
us out of the valley?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a possibility, isn&rsquo;t it? I was thinking about it
last night, Ken, before I dropped off to sleep. Maybe
someone stumbled onto Old Stony&rsquo;s secret long before
we came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A prospector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, the gold&rsquo;s gone&mdash;if ever there was
any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Jack replied thoughtfully. &ldquo;If the
gold had been toted out, word of it would have
spread like wildfire. Beside, wouldn&rsquo;t the discoverer
have cleared out of the valley as fast as he could,
once he had the cache?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all too deep for me,&rdquo; Ken answered with a
shrug. &ldquo;My bones tell me, though, that we&rsquo;d better
be prepared for a dose of trouble before we&rsquo;re
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Double trouble,&rdquo; Jack added with a grin.</p>
<p>By two o&rsquo;clock doubt again began to assail the
climbers. The going was hard once more, and the
pass seemed as elusive as ever. The prospect of
having to retreat a second time sent shivers of weariness
down the spines of the Scouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t make it today, we&rsquo;ll have to turn
back to Elks Creek,&rdquo; Mr. Warner announced.</p>
<p>Presently, from a high point which gave a clear
view of the surrounding peaks he made another
careful survey. Impatiently, the others awaited his
verdict.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I see what might be called twin peaks,&rdquo;
he said finally. &ldquo;If so, we&rsquo;re close to the pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words cheered everyone. Jack even hummed
a little tune as he tramped on. The heavy pack
actually felt lighter on his back.</p>
<p>The feeling of exultation grew as signs gave increasing
encouragement that this time their way
would not be blocked. Soon the Explorers came out
on the round top of the mountain.</p>
<p>While the others drank in the view, Warner and
Jack searched for a way down into the green valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see the tiny lake from here,&rdquo; the rancher
pointed out. &ldquo;We ought to reach it before nightfall.
And if all goes well, the plane should soon drop our
supplies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After careful consideration, Warner selected a
route down which did not look too difficult. Mr.
Livingston and Ken were willing enough to leave,
for the bald dome was wind-swept and uncomfortably
chilly. Patches of snow lay in the more protected
crannies.</p>
<p>In crossing an open space to join Jack and the
rancher, Ken abruptly halted. He directed the attention
of his companions to moccasin prints, plainly
visible in the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we thought we were the first to reach this
pass!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>The prints, the Scouts decided, had been made
within a short time&mdash;but by whom? They were fairly
certain that Walz had been wearing shoes and not
moccasins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any Indians living on Crazy Mountain?&rdquo; Hap
Livingston asked the rancher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I ever heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Led by Warner, the Scouts started soberly down
through the pass. Now that their objective was close,
they wondered all the more at the dangers. Walz
and Ranier, of course, were known hazards who, even
though they might be hostile, could be dealt
with. But what of the unknown inhabitant of the
mountain?</p>
<p>Thoughts were tumbling without pattern in Jack&rsquo;s
mind, when Warner up ahead suddenly halted. Pulling
himself up short, Jack saw that the rancher was
staring fixedly at something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Without replying, the rancher moved aside so that
the others could see.</p>
<p>A stunted pine was growing out of a rock at a
rakish angle and dangling from its twisted lower
limb was a skeleton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 19</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CABIN</span></h2>
<p>At sight of the swinging skeleton, the Scouts
stood rooted to the rocks. Jack was the first to recover
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers! Is it a warning intended for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little hint we&rsquo;re to go no farther?&rdquo; demanded
Ken.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, the skeleton proved to
be one of a bear with several head bones missing. Mr.
Livingston cut it down with his pocket knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may be walking into a trap,&rdquo; Warner conceded.
&ldquo;From the map, I judge there&rsquo;s no entrance
or exit to Headless Hollow except through this
narrow pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean once down there we may find it hard
to get back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We face that chance. There&rsquo;s no question this
skeleton was hung here as a warning. It was probably
meant for anyone who might chance this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the valley must hold treasure,&rdquo; Ken said, his
eyes kindling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t build up that hope,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
warned him. &ldquo;We may be dealing with a man who
is out of his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what alarms me,&rdquo; agreed Craig Warner.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel safer if I had my gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re four to one,&rdquo; Ken pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; the rancher replied, &ldquo;but numbers can be
misleading. Besides, we don&rsquo;t know for sure if
there&rsquo;s only one against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the discussion, no one considered turning
back. The climbers had suffered too intensely
to think of giving up their objective now. At least
the valley was attainable, and the route down did
not look too hard. But certainly the warning skeleton
had alerted them to possible danger, and they knew
they had to remain constantly on guard.</p>
<p>Pressing on, the Scouts followed Warner single
file down the slope.</p>
<p>Deep blue shadows were lengthening by the
time the four swung through a deeply wooded area.
Here they proceeded with even greater caution. But,
without incident, they finally came out on a flat shelf
overlooking the valley.</p>
<p>With a common impulse, everyone halted, for
the view snatched away their breath. A tiny sapphire
lake lay far below. Against the dark backdrop
of the mountainside stood a tiny cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;That must be the place Stony and my father
built,&rdquo; Warner said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve reached our goal&mdash;Headless
Hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not the gold,&rdquo; Ken reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t concern me too much,&rdquo; the rancher
replied. &ldquo;If Stony left a cache and it&rsquo;s still here,
I admit I&rsquo;d like to have it. I could enlarge my ranch,
rebuild the barn, and make a lot of repairs. But
getting the ore out of this valley would take some
doing, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With darkness fast coming on, the Scouts pushed
rapidly along. Gone was all fatigue. An excitement
which steadily mounted buoyed up their spirits and
made them forget their weariness.</p>
<p>The sun was nearly down when at last the party
trudged up to the cabin they had seen from the
distance. They approached cautiously, mindful that
Walz and his guide or the unknown inhabitant of
Crazy Mountain might have taken refuge there.
They found no one, though. Jack pointed out that
the cabin logs were in a remarkable state of preservation
for having stood so long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cabin has been kept repaired,&rdquo; Warner announced
after he had looked it over.</p>
<p>Telling the Scouts and Mr. Livingston to keep
back, he crept to the glassless cabin window and
peered in. Seeing no one, he motioned that it was
safe for the others to approach.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>The cabin was practically without a floor, since
the boards had deteriorated. Furniture consisted
of a broken-down table, a stool, and a pile of fir
boughs which had served as someone&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<p>Jack went over and touched the ashes in the
crumbling fireplace. &ldquo;Warm,&rdquo; he reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has certainly been living here recently,&rdquo;
Warner said. &ldquo;No sign of anyone around now,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too late to search that night for the caches
of gold ore which Old Stony had claimed he hid
in the hollow. Feeling almost as if they were intruders
in the valley, the Scouts set about preparing
supper.</p>
<p>Warner fished the lake, bringing in a nice mess
of trout. It heartened the group. They had decided
to hoard enough of the meager supplies for an
emergency return to Elks Creek if necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie and War should be able to get help to us
by tomorrow,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said. &ldquo;If the Forest
Service plane drops food, we&rsquo;ll be all right. But if
the plan goes amiss for any reason, we may have
a rough time of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was closing in chilly, with a threat of
rain, so the Scouts decided to sleep inside the cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>A fire brought a little cheer to the dreary room.
Mr. Livingston and Craig Warner told a few stories
of past experiences in the wilds. However, talk soon
died for, although no one said so openly, the atmosphere
was oppressive.</p>
<p>Twice Jack left the fire to gaze out the open
window. He couldn&rsquo;t see anyone in the dark, yet
he couldn&rsquo;t rid himself of the feeling that someone
was prowling near the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we ought to post a guard?&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; Warner agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a light
sleeper, though, so maybe we can take a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before turning in, he and Mr. Livingston made
a tour of the cabin area. Everything was quiet. A
light rain, however, had started to fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may prevent the plane from dropping our
food tomorrow,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston remarked, scanning
the sky.</p>
<p>The Scouts made up their beds and turned in.
Jack was too weary to sleep. After a while, above
the sound of the rain, he thought he heard footsteps
outside the cabin. Quickly, he got up.</p>
<p>Before he could investigate, the door was flung
open. Jarrett Walz, his clothing torn and wet, staggered
in.</p>
<p>His arrival awakened the others, and Ken built
up the fire, which provided a flickering light in the
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ranier?&rdquo; Warner demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;That yellow dog deserted me,&rdquo; Walz muttered,
collapsing onto the bed of pine boughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You quarreled?&rdquo; the rancher guessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Walz admitted sullenly. &ldquo;I made it here
after he left me at the pass. The thief took my food.
I&rsquo;m half starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident that the motel owner had suffered
severely on the trail. Despite their intense dislike
for the man, the Scouts could not help feeling sorry
for him.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston brewed him a cup of strong tea
and used the last of the flour to make pancakes
for him. Walz ate ravenously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did Ranier turn back?&rdquo; Warner asked when
the motel owner had finished eating. &ldquo;You say you
quarreled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost constantly. He said I wasn&rsquo;t paying him
enough for the risk of the trip, and that I wasn&rsquo;t
doing my share of the camp work. Then we came
to the pass&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the bear skeleton?&rdquo; Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. That finished Ranier. He said the valley
was evil and he wouldn&rsquo;t set foot in it. So he
deserted me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the map you stole from me?&rdquo; Warner
asked.</p>
<p>Walz eyed him defiantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hand it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun I will! I didn&rsquo;t all but kill myself to
get here, only to make things easy for you. Oh, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can take the map,&rdquo; the rancher quietly reminded
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Walz sneered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not dumb enough
to walk in here with it in my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hidden it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than that. I&rsquo;ve destroyed it.&rdquo; Triumphantly,
the motel owner tapped his forehead. &ldquo;The
secret is here&mdash;right here. Known only to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warner shrugged. He had no reason to doubt
Walz&rsquo; statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may regret destroying the map,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;A memory sometimes proves faulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not mine,&rdquo; Walz boasted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find that gold,
and it will be mine&mdash;all mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re loco,&rdquo; Warner retorted. &ldquo;We ought to
heave you out of here, but we&rsquo;ll be generous&mdash;a
weakness you wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts made room for the motel owner near
the fire. He had not feigned exhaustion. Almost at
once he fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should make no trouble tonight,&rdquo; Warner
said contemptuously. &ldquo;Tomorrow may be a different
story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Once more the Scouts turned in for the night.
Again Jack slept, though fitfully. At times he imagined
Walz was stirring. Always it was his fancy.
Then again, he imagined he heard a noise outside
the cabin.</p>
<p>Actually, it was toward morning when he awoke
with a start. His imagination again?</p>
<p>Suddenly he knew that it was not. He felt smothered,
suffocated.</p>
<p>Starting up, he began to cough and choke. The
cabin was filled with smoke!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 20</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE PLANE</span></h2>
<p>For a moment, Jack thought the cabin was on
fire. But there were no flames. Groping his way
through the blinding smoke, he flung open the
door.</p>
<p>As he reached the better air, he heard a hard thud
on the ground at the rear of the wretched cabin.
Then, in the semi-darkness, he saw a shadowy figure
darting toward the dense bush rimming the lake.</p>
<p>By this time, Ken too was awake, coughing and
fighting the smoke. The others quickly rose and
made their way out into the night air.</p>
<p>If Jack had cherished any thought that Walz was
responsible for the condition of the cabin, it was
dispelled. The motel owner staggered out, rubbing
his eyes and whining that he had been asphyxiated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You closed the flue!&rdquo; he accused them. &ldquo;You
wanted to get rid of me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>The Scouts paid no attention to his mutterings.
Instead, Jack and Ken checked the fireplace. Smoke
from the half-burned-out fire was pouring into the
room instead of rising up the flue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be a down draft,&rdquo; Ken said, fighting the
smoke. &ldquo;The air&rsquo;s heavy because of the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that heavy, Ken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack recollected the strange thudding noise he
had heard and the fleeting shadow he had seen.
Someone, he was convinced, had been on the roof
of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see what&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;Help me up there, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may crash through the roof,&rdquo; Ken warned.
&ldquo;One good puff of wind and this whole place will
fall down like a cardboard box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and Craig Warner gave Jack a boost onto the
sloping roof. In a moment they heard his shout of discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder we were smoked out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Ken demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hunk of wood has been jammed down the
chimney! The smoke couldn&rsquo;t escape, so it went
out into the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack tugged and pulled, but the piece of wood
had been wedged tightly into the chimney. Ken
climbed up with a hatchet. Together they chopped
the chunk to splinters, then dropped back down
onto the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo; Walz demanded in a shaky voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ghost of Old Stony,&rdquo; Jack replied in jest.
&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s upset to find us in his valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At mention of the old prospector, Walz seemed
to go to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be saying things like that!&rdquo; he fairly
screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; Jack apologized. &ldquo;It was only a joke. I
don&rsquo;t know any more than you do about who
wedged that wood into the chimney. But it was
done on purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going back in there tonight,&rdquo; Walz
whined with a shudder. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a wonder we
weren&rsquo;t burned in our beds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time, the sky had grown lighter, an indication
that dawn was not far off. The clouds were
clearing, and the rain had stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Willie and War got through to the Forest
Service station, we may sight their plane today,&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston said hopefully.</p>
<p>No one attempted to go back to sleep. Warner and
Jack made a brief but futile search for their mysterious
enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect it&rsquo;s the same fellow who stole our food
and my gun,&rdquo; the rancher said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it&rsquo;s somebody who has been living here
in the valley?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way, Jack. Who he is, or how he
manages to keep alive, I don&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll have to
be eternally on guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston and Ken had fished the lake during
their absence, and now near the cabin they
proudly displayed four good-sized trout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Walz?&rdquo; Ken suddenly asked.</p>
<p>The motel owner was not to be found near the
cabin nor in it. Very shortly the Scouts learned
the reason: during their absence, he had disappeared.
With him had gone their few remaining
supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that thieving rascal!&rdquo; Warner exclaimed.
&ldquo;We took pity on him and shared what little we
had. This is our pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only a perfunctory search was made for Walz.
It was certain he had taken refuge in the bush not
far from the cabin, but to track him down would
have been a difficult and useless task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By this time, he&rsquo;ll have hidden what he can&rsquo;t
consume,&rdquo; Warner said in disgust. &ldquo;He probably
figures on finding those caches and getting out of
here fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast was a disheartening meal. The fish,
baked in leaves, was tasteless without salt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not starve,&rdquo; Warner said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s sure we
have to replenish our supply of staples or hit the
trail for Elks Creek. The question is, can we be sure
that Willie and War have gotten help for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston spoke with quiet confidence: &ldquo;Unless
they had some bad luck the plane will get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good flying weather today,&rdquo; Ken added cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s settled then that we stick it out,&rdquo; Warner
said.</p>
<p>They decided that one of them should remain
close to the clearing throughout the day to make
certain the plane would not be missed. Selecting a
fairly level place where the packages of food might
be parachuted down, Jack laid out a bright-colored
cloth as a signal.</p>
<p>In the meantime Warner, Mr. Livingston, and Ken
set off to try to find the gold caches. At noon they
returned, tired, hungry, and discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck,&rdquo; Ken reported, &ldquo;but we did find a
grave on a hillside not far from the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Craig Warner said. &ldquo;There was a
marker with his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An odd thing,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston contributed.
&ldquo;Ferns and flowers have been planted beside the
grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recently too,&rdquo; added Ken. &ldquo;At least, the earth
around them has been loosened recently.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Warner gazed toward the distant mountains,
glistening in the bright sunlight. &ldquo;This trip has already
been worth while for me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The gold
doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is gold!&rdquo; Jack insisted. &ldquo;At least, when
I was at the lake I saw particles of it that had
washed down from the hills. And I found a sluice
box someone had been using.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our unknown enemy, probably,&rdquo; Warner said.
&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t show himself while we were gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any sign of a plane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Ken took his turn staying behind,
while the others resumed search for the caches of
ore. According to Warner&rsquo;s recollection of the map,
both had been near the entrance to a ravine some
distance from the lake, but the morning search had
proven unfruitful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have made a miscalculation,&rdquo; the rancher
admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we picked the wrong ravine,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>They began the afternoon search nearer the lake
and cabin. Immediately, landmarks seemed somewhat
more familiar and similar to the chart markings
they remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be on the right track!&rdquo; Jack said jubilantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>They were encouraged to find old holes drilled in
the hillside. This they took to be evidence that Old
Stony or other prospectors who followed him had
tested the area as a possible mine site.</p>
<p>But the hiding place, if ever there had been one,
could not be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Walz has had better luck,&rdquo; Jack said,
sinking down on a rock. &ldquo;Queer we haven&rsquo;t had a
glimpse of him all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying low,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston said. &ldquo;Either
that, or he&rsquo;s hit out for Elks Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disheartened, the trio finally headed back toward
the cabin. As they rounded a ridge, Jack suddenly
stiffened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faintly in the distance, they could hear the drone
of an airplane engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;War and Willie are sending help!&rdquo; Jack cried.
&ldquo;Food!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all haste, the three fought their way up the
crumbling rocks. Reaching a high spot, they eagerly
scanned the sky.</p>
<p>Far to the east, a tiny moving speck could be
discerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming this way!&rdquo; Jack shouted. &ldquo;The pilot
can&rsquo;t miss the lake!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Although the plane was still far away, he took
off his hat and began waving it in a wide arc. He
might have spared himself the trouble.</p>
<p>The plane came on closer for a moment longer
and then, for no apparent reason, it banked and
turned back on its course.</p>
<p>Jack kept thinking that it surely would circle
again. But it did not.</p>
<p>As he and his companions watched in stunned
silence, it vanished between the mountain peaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 21</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE ENEMY</span></h2>
<p>Heartsick, Jack, Craig Warner, and Hap Livingston
trudged back to the cabin. Ken, too, had seen
the plane from the woods where he had been gathering
a few edible berries. He reported that it had
not come close enough to the clearing for him to signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made it turn back?&rdquo; he grieved. &ldquo;Surely
the lake makes a sizable landmark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not have been the Forest Service plane,&rdquo;
said Warner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston declared.
&ldquo;Warwick and Willie may have had trouble getting
through. If anything happened to them&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll
always blame myself for letting them go off alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made it by now,&rdquo; Jack said.</p>
<p>However, he spoke with more confidence than
he felt. War&rsquo;s condition had not been the best, and
it was quite possible he had fallen ill on the trail.
Resolutely, he put the matter from his mind. There
was enough to worry about as it was, he told himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Any visitors while we were away?&rdquo; he asked
Ken as the group walked to the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a bear. He didn&rsquo;t stick around long when
he found there was no food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a glimpse of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hidden out in a canyon somewhere,&rdquo; Jack
guessed. &ldquo;He may give us trouble yet&mdash;especially if
we should find the gold before he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much chance of that,&rdquo; Ken replied. &ldquo;In fact,
I&rsquo;m beginning to think Stony dreamed up that gold.
The valley&rsquo;s real enough, but that cache may have
been all fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack made no answer. Weary, hungry, and discouraged,
he too wondered if the trip to Headless
Hollow might not have been a mistake. However,
he had no intention of saying so. Fetching water
from the lake, he went into the cabin and flung
himself onto the bed of boughs.</p>
<p>Despite his weariness, he did not lie there long.
Something which was propped against the fireplace
drew his gaze. He rolled off the bed and went over to
pick it up. It was a long strip of bark, and on the
inside surface a message had been printed in uneven
charcoal letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;GIT OUT OF THIS HEAR VALLEY BEFOR
IT IS TOO LATE.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Jack carried it outside to show to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walz never left this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That fellow who
tried to smoke us out last night must have printed
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an unfriendly coot,&rdquo; Warner observed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a mystery how he manages to live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken said he had seen no one near the cabin while
the others had been searching for the caches. Nevertheless,
he had been absent himself for half an hour.
It was during this period, they decided, that the
fellow had sneaked out of the woods to leave the
warning message.</p>
<p>After another frugal meal of fish and berries,
everyone except Warner turned in for the night. He
insisted upon keeping watch until midnight. At that
hour, Mr. Livingston relieved him. It was nearing
dawn when Jack awoke to see the Scout leader
dozing by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my turn now,&rdquo; he volunteered.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston reluctantly permitted him to take
over the watch. Jack sat a while with only his dreary
thoughts for company. In his mind&rsquo;s eye, he tried
to reconstruct the treasure map as first he had seen
it in Rocking Horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Definitely, he recalled that the two caches of gold
had been close to each other at the mouth of a ravine.
But the years might have wrought changes in the
terrain. Wind and rain and rock slides could have
altered the area.</p>
<p>For that matter, with the valley inhabited, might
not the gold long ago have been removed?</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s thoughts rambled back to his last talk with
Stony in the hospital. Then he had seriously doubted
that the prospector had found gold in this remote
valley. Now that he was here, he had gradually
begun to believe that the tale had been true.</p>
<p>The grave and marker with John Warner&rsquo;s name
indicated that Stony had indeed lost his partner in
Headless Hollow. Mystery still shrouded the death.
Restlessly, Jack rose and walked to the window.
The sky was beginning to lighten. Very soon the
sun would be up.</p>
<p>He built up the fire. Noticing that the supply of
wood was low, he took the axe and went for more.
He chopped a dead jackpine, stacking the pieces
near the cabin door.</p>
<p>As he went down to the lake for water, he thought
he heard mocking laughter from amid the willows.
But he could see no one, and when he halted to
listen, there was no further sound. He continued to
the water&rsquo;s edge and stooped to fill the vessel. Some
instinct warned him. He still had heard no sound
but, without knowing why, he whirled suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>A dark figure loomed behind him. He caught a
blurred impression of an aged face as he ducked.</p>
<p>A heavy object struck him a glancing blow on the
side of his head. Senses reeling, he staggered crazily
backward into the water as wild laughter rang in his
ears.</p>
<p>Dazed as he was, he realized his opponent had
struck him with the butt of Warner&rsquo;s stolen gun.
And now the crazed fellow was pointing it at him,
laughing idiotically!</p>
<p>Off balance from the stunning blow, Jack let himself
collapse into the lake. Then, fearful his assailant
would fire, or hurl a rock at him if he emerged, he
dived deeper.</p>
<p>Holding his breath, he went down into the chilly
depths until he struck sand, and then he swam
underwater. When his lungs screamed for air, he
cautiously rose to the surface. Raising his nose and
mouth just above water, he gazed toward shore.</p>
<p>At first the wild creature who had assaulted him
so viciously was nowhere to be seen. But as Jack
scanned the shore, he saw the dark figure retreating
as stealthily as he had come. He was a bent, twisted
man who moved with cat-like tread over the rocks
toward a distant ravine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Scrambling out on shore, Jack ran to the cabin.
He met Craig Warner, who only that moment had
dressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fell in the lake!&rdquo; Warner exclaimed, staring
at him.</p>
<p>Jack related what had happened and added:
&ldquo;The fellow who attacked me is as crazy as this
mountain! He headed for the far ravine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going after him,&rdquo; Warner said.</p>
<p>Jack would not allow the rancher to trail the old
man alone. Without taking time to change his wet
clothes, he guided Warner in the direction his attacker
had taken.</p>
<p>The sky was rapidly brightening. At the edge of
the ravine they caught their first glimpse of the old
man. He wore moccasins and moved with amazing
swiftness over the rough terrain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, he&rsquo;ll lead us to Old Stony&rsquo;s
gold,&rdquo; Warner whispered. &ldquo;Our best bet is to keep
out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agile as a monkey, the old fellow scrambled over
the rocks with the energy of a much younger man.
He came at last, as the rancher predicted, to a pit
opening that was covered by brush.</p>
<p>Not even glancing about, the man pulled the
debris aside and dropped out of view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mine, all right,&rdquo; Warner declared as he
and Jack crouched behind the bushes, waiting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stony&rsquo;s caches of ore must be somewhere close,&rdquo;
Jack whispered.</p>
<p>Warner nodded. &ldquo;Probably, unless this daffy old
fellow has moved them. He has certainly been living
here a long while, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the sun was up, and Jack&rsquo;s wet clothing
had begun to dry a little. But he remained cold,
uncomfortable, and drowsy. He craved action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we try to find out what&rsquo;s doing down
in that mine?&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may stay down in that hole all day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come out sooner or later. We&rsquo;d be crazy
to go after him, Jack. Remember, he has a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Jack conceded with a sigh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard
to wait, though. What&rsquo;s he doing down there, anyhow?
Counting his gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Digging it, more than likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s tired eyes sparkled. &ldquo;You think we&rsquo;ve stumbled
onto Old Stony&rsquo;s source of gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found something,&rdquo; Warner grunted. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t forget, Colorado is thick with abandoned
mines&mdash;most of &rsquo;em worthless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the sun rose higher, Jack became convinced the
old fellow would never reappear. He was half asleep,
when Warner unexpectedly nudged him. Then he
came awake with a start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>The old man could be seen backing awkwardly
out of the pit hole.</p>
<p>In the bright daylight, he looked like a grotesque
creature with long, windblown white hair and a
straggling, dirty-white beard.</p>
<p>But Jack was not inclined to chuckle. The old
fellow had an intensity of purpose which was frightening.
He was chattering to himself, but the only
word the listening pair could distinguish was:
&ldquo;Gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as they watched, the old man turned his
half-glazed eyes toward the bush where they
crouched. In that instant Warner obtained his first
direct look at the withered, weather-tanned face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;you know!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
Joe Hansart!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 22</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TRAPPED</span></h2>
<p>The gaunt man who had crawled from the mine
pit did not see them crouching in the dense thicket.
He stood facing them, however, a revolver dangling
carelessly at his belt. He was a grotesque, powerfully
built fellow amazingly agile, and he was wearing
a ragged, red-wool shirt and an open, tattered
leather jacket.</p>
<p>As Jack and the rancher watched, Joe Hansart
wheeled and trotted off over the rocks in the general
direction of the pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We missed our chance to nab him,&rdquo; Jack said,
emerging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he has my gun, and it&rsquo;s probably loaded,&rdquo;
Warner replied. &ldquo;If he sees us he may shoot. The
poor old fellow seems completely off his rocker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very well, but he&rsquo;s Joe Hansart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he the prospector you mentioned at your
ranch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Years ago I saw him a few times.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell us at the ranch that he had set
out for this hollow and vanished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the rancher answered. &ldquo;So far as I know,
Joe hasn&rsquo;t been seen in Elks Creek for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how has he managed to live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warner shrugged. &ldquo;Who knows? Maybe he makes
trips out, though not to Elks Creek. Probably he
stashes food for the winter. In the summer, a man of
his ingenuity could get along on very little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would he stay here year after year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently he&rsquo;s been seized with gold fever, Jack,
and it has twisted his brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he&rsquo;s found Old Stony&rsquo;s caches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect so, Jack. Perhaps he has even stumbled
onto a rich vein in that pit mine. Let&rsquo;s find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making certain the old prospector had not
doubled back on his trail, the two dropped down
into the hole.</p>
<p>The mine was a shallow one, bolstered with
crudely cut timber. Water dripped from above,
making the floor slippery and slimy. Warner&rsquo;s flashlight
came to rest on a box of dynamite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch it!&rdquo; he advised sharply, as Jack would
have investigated. &ldquo;That stuff&rsquo;s old&mdash;and dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little farther on they came to a pile of mined
ore. Warner picked up one of the chunks of rock,
studying the dull-looking metal under the flashlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>&ldquo;This looks like rich stuff!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
hand sorted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Stony was right!&rdquo; Jack cried. &ldquo;He did find
a fortune, only to lose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to tell until the stuff is assayed, but this ore
looks rich to me. Almost pure gold, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a lot of it! Piles and piles! Old Joe
Hansart must have been mining it here for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warner went on to a second and third pile of ore,
but his enthusiasm began to die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Jack demanded, puzzled by the
rancher&rsquo;s change of attitude. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it gold, after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gold, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not quality stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s hard to tell much just by looking at it,
Jack. That first pile of hand-sorted stuff was rich&mdash;no
question about it. But this&mdash;&rdquo; Warner dropped
a chunk of ore contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worthless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that. I&rsquo;m no expert. It&rsquo;s easy to
see, though, that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not the same rich ore as that
first pile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, there&rsquo;s a lot of it,&rdquo; Jack said optimistically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that one pile might be worth thousands,&rdquo;
Craig Warner replied. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s available to anybody
who hauls it out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose Joe Hansart hasn&rsquo;t done
it?&rdquo; Jack speculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two reasons probably: one, he hasn&rsquo;t wanted
anyone to know of his discovery; two, ore is heavy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You figure Hansart never filed a claim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it, Jack. If he had, word would have
swept this section of country like a prairie fire. He&rsquo;s
probably panned enough pure gold from the lake
to keep him in supplies. Meanwhile, he has stayed
on here alone, enlarging the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short distance further into the pit, they came to
a tunnel opening which had been half covered with
debris. Pulling the brush aside, Warner ran the
beam of his light over the rough wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems to be where Hansart has done his
most recent work,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;You can see the
vein. But it&rsquo;s thin&mdash;played out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this is only another worthless mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t pass judgment on such a brief inspection,&rdquo;
Warner returned. &ldquo;Besides, as I say, I&rsquo;m not
an expert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t look too promising to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, it doesn&rsquo;t, Jack. I don&rsquo;t want to build up
your hopes, only to have them collapse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hadn&rsquo;t figured on cashing in on this trip
except in fun and experience,&rdquo; Jack rejoined cheerfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s gold here,&rdquo; Warner said soberly. &ldquo;These
days, though, it takes capital&mdash;lots of it&mdash;to operate
any mine profitably. Headless Hollow is hard to get
at. So to make it worth while, the vein would have
to be exceedingly rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went on to the end of the narrow tunnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my opinion the vein was better near the surface,&rdquo;
Craig Warner said, as he and Jack turned
back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of those freak things. Old Stony
thought he had made a rich find. He must have found
ore that would be worth maybe twenty to fifty thousand
dollars in the present market. But the streak
seemingly plays out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mightn&rsquo;t it pick up again somewhere in the
valley?&rdquo; Jack suggested hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But if in all these years Joe Hansart hasn&rsquo;t
improved on this site, I doubt there&rsquo;s any bonanza
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lure of gold, though, has held him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; Warner agreed. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the tragedy
of it. Poor Joe! I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s to be done about
him. He&rsquo;s dangerous in his present state of mind, and
it won&rsquo;t be easy to help him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He already regards me as Enemy No. 1,&rdquo; Jack
said with a rueful chuckle. &ldquo;My head still aches from
that crack he gave me on the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s probably afraid we&rsquo;re here to steal his gold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. He must have been the one who
stole our food at the ghost town. And he must be
the one who put up that animal skeleton at the
entrance to the pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except for Joe, this valley must have been uninhabited
for years,&rdquo; Warner said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Prospectors who drifted this way always got into
trouble&mdash;minor accidents, food disappearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hansart must have been behind it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly wasn&rsquo;t suspected, Jack. But what
we&rsquo;ve seen today convinces me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No search ever was made for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None that I recall, Jack. You see, Joe was a queer
one, even as a young man. The lone-wolf type. He
had no relatives anyone ever heard about. When
he&rsquo;d vanish for a year or so at a time, no one thought
anything of it. Then finally the story grew that he&rsquo;d
disappeared on a prospecting trip into this valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have lived in that wreck of a cabin
we took over&mdash;the one built by your father and Old
Stony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Warner agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d guess that gold ore
we found at the mine entrance&mdash;the good stuff&mdash;came
from the original cache and poor old Joe stored
it in here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he keeps pretty close watch of this
mine,&rdquo; Jack remarked, a note of uneasiness in his
voice. &ldquo;How long have we been down here, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out,&rdquo; Jack urged, starting over the
rough, uneven tunnel floor.</p>
<p>Warner&rsquo;s flashlight guided them to the main opening
into the mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must still be pretty dark outside,&rdquo; Jack remarked,
mystified because no daylight filtered down.
&ldquo;A fellow can&rsquo;t see an inch ahead of his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He groped on up the rough steps in the rock. But
where the exit to the mine should have been, his
hand encountered first a mass of brush, and then
solid rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s wrong!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;This can&rsquo;t be
the way we came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it is,&rdquo; Warner insisted, pressing close behind
him. &ldquo;This mine is a simple affair. No offshoots.
Here, let me have a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His light beam swept the mine exit.</p>
<p>Both the rancher and Jack drew in their breath
sharply.</p>
<p>The opening through which they had entered a
few minutes before was now blocked. They were
trapped in the mine!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 23</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ESCAPE</span></h2>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s first thought was that a rock slide had
dammed up the mine entrance. Sober reflection,
however, told him that such was not the case.</p>
<p>Obviously, someone had quietly shoved a great
boulder across the narrow opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Hansart!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;He must have seen
us come in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trapped, all right,&rdquo; Warner muttered.</p>
<p>He and Jack applied their shoulders and heaved
with all their strength. They could move the rock
a trifle, but not enough to shift it from its position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Other rocks have been piled on top,&rdquo; Warner
gasped.</p>
<p>Once more the pair worked and heaved in unison,
but without the slightest success.</p>
<p>Exhausted, they sank back against the rock wall
to consider their desperate plight. Soon they would
be missed at the cabin. That was certain. But it
was doubtful Ken or Mr. Livingston would pick
up their trail to this remote ravine until many hours,
perhaps days had passed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Meanwhile, they were without food or water. And
Joe Hansart might lie in wait for any rescuers and
attack them as he had attacked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy coot!&rdquo; Warner exclaimed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s outwitted
us. We became so intent on exploring the mine that
we forgot everything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Jack directed suddenly.</p>
<p>He was certain he had heard a scratching sound
on the huge rock above their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s Joe Hansart piling on more stones!&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p>Together, the trapped pair shouted. At once the
scraping sound ceased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s out there,&rdquo; Warner decided. &ldquo;It must
be Joe. Maybe if we can convince him we don&rsquo;t want
any of his gold, he&rsquo;ll relent and let us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shouted, but only their own voices echoed
weirdly back in the pit. Desperately, they shoved
again at the rock barrier. This time they succeeded
in dislodging enough of the loose debris to permit
a little daylight to filter down.</p>
<p>As they nursed their bruised hands, they heard
harsh laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, listen to reason!&rdquo; Warner bellowed at him.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want your stupid gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; asked a mocking voice.</p>
<p>Warner and Jack stiffened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Walz!&rdquo; the latter identified him. &ldquo;Not
Hansart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a fleeting instant, the two prisoners took heart.
They thought they would be able to reason with
the motel owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Warner shouted to him. &ldquo;There must
have been a rock slide. Help us get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should I do that?&rdquo; the motel owner
asked in the same mocking tone. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t make
any trouble where you are now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lost your senses?&rdquo; Warner stormed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite the contrary,&rdquo; Walz rejoined, plainly enjoying
his triumph. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve both been a pain in my
neck ever since I set eyes on you. Now you get what
you deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea blocking the exit?&rdquo; Warner demanded.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My game? Only a little device to gain time. It
was your bad luck that you stumbled onto the
vein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vein&mdash;&rdquo; Warner started to explode, then held
his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I saw you sneak into the mine after the old
man went away,&rdquo; Walz rattled on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been down here yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; the motel owner admitted. His voice
carried plainly to the pair below, for he was close
to the opening between the rocks. &ldquo;I found the gold
ore, and I have samples now in my pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you aiming to do with &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have them assayed. But first I&rsquo;m staking out a
claim to this section of the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure someone hasn&rsquo;t beaten you to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is unclaimed valley&mdash;the entire hollow. Ranier
told me so. That dirty, low-down scamp deserted
me. I&rsquo;ll get even with him when I get back
to Elks Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Warner said in exasperation, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had
your little joke. Now let us out of here. We can&rsquo;t
raise that rock from below, but you can roll it aside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can, but I&rsquo;m not going to do it,&rdquo; Walz
retorted coolly. &ldquo;You trailed me to Headless Hollow,
but you&rsquo;re not going to beat me filing a claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wants to file one, you stupid ox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; the motel owner accused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve risked
everything to get this gold. Nothing is going to stop
me now. Nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to the gold&mdash;whatever you can
find,&rdquo; Warner said wearily. &ldquo;Just let us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first, the trapped pair had not believed that the
motel owner seriously meant to keep them confined
below, but his intention could no longer be doubted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;Walz, pay close attention,&rdquo; Warner pleaded. &ldquo;I
came to this place largely to see the grave of my
father. The gold&mdash;if there was any&mdash;didn&rsquo;t mean too
much to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means everything to you, but you have the
wrong slant. Unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, this mine would
never pay well enough to interest a company. Old
Stony gathered some rich ore, it&rsquo;s true. He died
without knowing that the vein wasn&rsquo;t extensive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasting your breath,&rdquo; Walz retorted.
&ldquo;Talk till you&rsquo;re blue in the face. It won&rsquo;t move me.
I have my samples of gold, and I&rsquo;m hitting the trail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walz&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer. The two prisoners realized
that he had carried out his threat and left. They
were indeed trapped in the mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hap and Ken will start searching any minute
now,&rdquo; Jack said, trying to remain cheerful. &ldquo;If they
come this way, they may see that pile of rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And again they may not,&rdquo; Warner grunted. &ldquo;We
may never be found until it&rsquo;s too late. Walz is a
blackguard, if I ever met one! Like as not, even after
he&rsquo;s filed his claim he won&rsquo;t send anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always Joe Hansart. He&rsquo;ll be coming
back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Warner agreed, &ldquo;our best hope probably
lies with him. But the old coot may stay away for
days. Meanwhile, we can get pretty fed up in this
hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two sat down, their backs to the rough wall.
Jack&rsquo;s clothing had only partially dried after his
ducking in the lake, so he was damp and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get out of here,&rdquo; Warner said determinedly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get pneumonia, if we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No exit except this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tunnel ended against a blank wall. I checked
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Walz could push that stone into place alone,
the two of us ought to be able to shove it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pushing against gravity, Jack. He rolled it
down the incline. Besides, once he got it into place,
he piled on other rocks and debris. We&rsquo;re caught
like two animals in a cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Jack straightened as a thought occurred
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dynamite!&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Any chance we
could blast our way out of here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we could!&rdquo; the rancher exclaimed. &ldquo;It
would be risky business, though. Old dynamite, especially,
is dangerous to handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tiny charge would turn the trick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Warner grinned, &ldquo;providing we aren&rsquo;t both
blown to bits before we set it off. But I&rsquo;m willing to
try. Anything&rsquo;s better than just waiting in this hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rancher would not allow Jack to go near the
stored boxes. He insisted, &ldquo;You go and take refuge
in the far end of the tunnel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Using the utmost care, Warner placed the dynamite
sticks without accident. Breathing hard, he
joined Jack after the fuse had been set. For a full
minute, they waited tensely. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stuff is dead,&rdquo; Jack declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Warner said. &ldquo;It was a long fuse.
Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited. Suddenly the tunnel was rocked by
a terrific explosion. As they hit the earth, covering
their faces, small bits of rock showered down. When
the dust had cleared, they groped their way back
to the entrance. Climbing up through the debris,
they saw daylight. Warner squeezed out through the
tumbled rocks, and reached down to help Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re free and still in one piece,&rdquo; the rancher
chuckled.</p>
<p>Setting out from the ravine, they started for the
cabin. However, they had covered less than a third
of the distance when they saw Hap Livingston and
Ken coming toward them at a run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Ken demanded, as he
glimpsed the dirt-streaked faces and disheveled
clothing of the two. &ldquo;We heard an explosion!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Tersely, Jack and the rancher related their harrowing
experience in the mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Walz is streaking for Elks Creek!&rdquo; Warner
ended the account. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on a fool&rsquo;s chase, in my
opinion. I could be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we try to head him off?&rdquo; Jack proposed
eagerly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not had too big a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take long to sling our equipment together,&rdquo;
Ken added. &ldquo;Maybe we can overtake him.
We have a score to settle, regardless of the gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not be necessary,&rdquo; Warner advised quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 24</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A FIGHT</span></h2>
<p>His words were mystifying. Then the other three
noticed that the rancher had turned his gaze toward
the distant pass which guarded Headless Hollow.
Far above them, on the high cliffs, they saw two
struggling men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walz and Joe Hansart!&rdquo; Jack exclaimed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The watchers below were too far away to see the
struggle plainly. It was apparent, though, what had
happened. Evidently Walz had attempted to leave
the valley with his sack of sample gold, and Joe
Hansart had caught him. Now the two were locked
in a death struggle. As the Explorers watched in
horror, the two men fought close to the edge of the
cliffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll kill each other, if we don&rsquo;t stop them!&rdquo;
Mr. Livingston exclaimed.</p>
<p>At a run, he and the others started for the
pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>The trail, such as it was, wound in a gradual climb.
Jack and Ken tried the steeper, direct route. Even
so, they were less than a third of the way up to the
cliff when they heard a hoarse, frightened shout.</p>
<p>Joe Hansart, despite his age, had overpowered his
adversary. Inch by inch, he crowded him to the
edge of the precipice. Walz rocked back and forth
on the ledge, fighting for his life. Beneath him
yawned the chasm.</p>
<p>The end of that desperate struggle was inevitable.</p>
<p>Walz&rsquo; boot went over the slanting rock. He tried
wildly to regain a foothold, but could not. As he fell,
he held fast to the old man, pulling him along.</p>
<p>Locked in each other&rsquo;s arms, the two men fell
to a ledge fifteen or twenty feet below. There they
struck bushes which in part broke their fall. Then
over and over they rolled, to the bottom of the long
slope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an end!&rdquo; Ken gasped, shuddering.</p>
<p>Peering over the cliff, Jack saw Walz move one of
his hands. It revived his hope that the motel owner
at least might have survived the long drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;A rope!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken went as fast as he could back to the cabin.
Without waiting, Jack scrambled down the steep
slope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>He lost his footing almost at once and rolled. He
managed to break the fall with his hands, and
brought himself to a stop, unhurt, not far from the
two injured men.</p>
<p>Joe Hansart, he saw at a glance, was the more
seriously injured. The old man lay in a crumpled
heap, bleeding from a head wound. Walz was conscious,
though in a state of semi-shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me,&rdquo; he whimpered. &ldquo;Help me. My leg is
broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring Walz for the moment, Jack checked Joe
Hansart&rsquo;s bleeding. The wound was superficial. The
old man, however, was pale, and his lips were blue.
His pulse was weak and rapid. He drew breath irregularly
and with difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; Jack advised. &ldquo;Help is on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved the old man so that his head lay downhill.
He was relieved to see that this position restored
Joe&rsquo;s color a trifle and improved his pulse, but
he saw that the prospector was quivering from shock
and chill. Stripping off his jacket, he covered the
old man.</p>
<p>Leaving him for the moment, he turned his attention
to the whimpering motel owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dying,&rdquo; Walz moaned. &ldquo;The pain is horrible.
Do something!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>It was plain to see that the motel owner&rsquo;s left
leg was broken. Possibly, too, he had suffered some
internal injuries. Jack, however, was inclined to
doubt it, for Walz, now that he had partially recovered
from the stunning impact, was becoming
talkative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move,&rdquo; Jack advised the moaning fellow.
&ldquo;Lie still until we can splint that leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walz, disregarding the order, tried to pull himself
to a sitting position. The effort brought new pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fool has done for me,&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
never get back to Elks Creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the way you left Warner and me trapped
in the mine, you don&rsquo;t deserve any help,&rdquo; Jack said.
&ldquo;We ought to leave you here to suffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were not meant to be serious. Walz
nevertheless considered them so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me here,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t walk
a step. I&rsquo;d never get back to Elks Creek alive. You
must help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a share of the gold,&rdquo; Walz whispered.
&ldquo;I swear it. I did wrong to take the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the way you left us in the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to send help to you as soon as I reached
Elks Creek,&rdquo; Walz mumbled.</p>
<p>Jack had his own opinion on this matter, but he let
it pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted the gold from the very first,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It was you, wasn&rsquo;t it, who broke into Old
Stony&rsquo;s cabin back in Rocking Horse? You beat him
when he woke up and found you trying to steal the
map!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motel owner&rsquo;s lips trembled, for he was not
willing to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was you,&rdquo; Jack went on, &ldquo;who stole
Stony&rsquo;s nuggets from the bag of pinto beans. If you
want any help, admit the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I going to die?&rdquo; Walz asked, his voice quavering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re miles from a doctor,&rdquo; Jack reminded him.
&ldquo;Unless we can get help to you, the situation is
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to die,&rdquo; Walz groaned. &ldquo;I&mdash;I may as
well tell you the truth and get it off my conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You slugged Old Stony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an accident. I went to the cabin, hoping
to get the map&mdash;yes, I admit that. The old man
woke up and tried to stop me. I flew into a rage and
hit him. Then I ran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Stony never knew it was you who tried to
rob him,&rdquo; Jack said. &ldquo;You can be thankful for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt terrible about it,&rdquo; Walz sobbed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mean to hurt Stony. Why, I liked the old duffer. I
gave him a good home. I fed and clothed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the thought of gold that turned you against
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I found the gold too,&rdquo; Walz whispered. &ldquo;It
meant to me more than anything else. Now I&rsquo;ve lost
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Mr. Livingston and Warner had
reached the site of the accident. Ken soon came with
the rope and first-aid supplies.</p>
<p>While Mr. Livingston made a splint for Walz&rsquo;
leg, the others improvised a stretcher. They bound
Joe Hansart to it, and by dint of great labor and
ingenuity they finally carried him down to the valley
floor and from there to the cabin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Scout leader had made Walz
fairly comfortable. Gradually, as it dawned upon
the motel owner that he might not die, he lapsed
into sullen silence.</p>
<p>It was only after he too had been transported to
the cabin that he began to deny his previous statements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was out of my head,&rdquo; he muttered to Jack. &ldquo;If
I said anything about harming Old Stony, it was the
bunk. I don&rsquo;t have any idea who broke into his
cabin at Rocking Horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and his friends avoided discussing the subject
further. Once they reached a town, they intended
to turn Walz over to the authorities. To get
out of the valley, however, was their first problem.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a bad spot,&rdquo; Warner admitted, drawing
the others aside for a serious conference. &ldquo;Both of
those men need a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hansart, especially,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston added. &ldquo;He
has scarcely opened his eyes since we got him here.
We need food and medical supplies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to do,&rdquo; Warner decided.
&ldquo;Something has happened to the Forest Service
plane, I&rsquo;m afraid. I&rsquo;ll start right away for Elks Creek.
The only thing&mdash;I hate to leave you alone here with
two injured men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make out,&rdquo; the Scout leader assured him.
&ldquo;Wait a few hours, though, before you start. If I
know Willie and War, they won&rsquo;t let us down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ken and Jack set out the signal cloth near the lake,
hoping that any pilot flying that way would see it.
Several hours elapsed.</p>
<p>The day was clear, with very little wind. Conditions
were nearly perfect for flying, yet no plane
appeared over the mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something must have happened to Willie and
War,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston declared, pacing nervously up
and down. &ldquo;Otherwise, help would have reached us
by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had plenty of time to get through,&rdquo;
Warner agreed. &ldquo;To wait and hope any longer is
foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>Without further discussion, he gathered his gear
together. Jack and Ken walked with him toward
the trail to the pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make as fast a trip as I can,&rdquo; he promised.</p>
<p>A bright glare was on the jagged mountain peaks.
Staring toward the pass, Jack thought he saw a small
moving speck in the sky. He rubbed his eyes. Imagination,
he told himself, for he had given up hope
that the plane would come.</p>
<p>Then Ken let out an excited shout. He too had
seen the moving object against the dark mountainside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming this way!&rdquo; Craig Warner cried,
dropping his pack.</p>
<p>For a few brief moments, the trio watched anxiously.
Would the plane turn back as it had done
on the previous occasion?</p>
<p>Warner finally identified it: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Forest Service
ship, with pontoons. Boys, I think it&rsquo;s heading
straight for the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fearful that the pilot might miss the cabin area
or falsely conclude that no one remained there, the
three made all haste back to the lake.</p>
<p>By the time they arrived there, breathless from
running, the roar of the powerful engines could be
heard distinctly. Hap Livingston had come hurrying
out of the cabin. Anxiously the four waited, waving
their arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Their signals were unnecessary. As the plane made
a practice run, the watchers knew that help had
arrived. In fact, as the Forest Service ship dropped
closer, Jack was able to recognize War and Willie
riding with the pilot.</p>
<p>Again the plane circled. Down fluttered a parachute
with packages of food attached. It hit the
ground about a hundred feet from where the Scouts
stood. Ken and Jack ran to retrieve it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be a help,&rdquo; Ken declared jubilantly.
&ldquo;But we need medicines&mdash;and a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Working fast, Mr. Livingston and Craig Warner
ripped up the signal cloth into two flags. These the
Scout leader attached to sticks. With the improvised
wigwag device, he then began sending the message:</p>
<p>&ldquo;TWO MEN BADLY HURT. NEED MORE
HELP.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over and over, he repeated the message. Whether
or not the flags could be correctly interpreted from
above, those on the ground had no way of knowing.
The plane, however, kept circling. Finally, the pilot
dipped the wings in signal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got it!&rdquo; Ken cried.</p>
<p>The watchers expected the plane to turn and head
back toward its base. Instead, it kept circling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pilot is going to try a landing on the lake!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Warner exclaimed. &ldquo;He can get in, all right, but will
he ever be able to take off again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seaplane came in low, skimmed above the
willows, and made a smooth landing. Jack, Ken,
and the two men waded out to meet their rescuers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read my wigwag!&rdquo; Mr. Livingston exclaimed,
embracing first Willie and then War, who splashed
out into the shallow water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t get a reading except on one word&mdash;&lsquo;HELP&rsquo;,&rdquo;
Willie admitted. &ldquo;We knew something was
really wrong, though, so we risked a landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you turn back on your first trip here?&rdquo;
Ken demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engine trouble,&rdquo; War explained briefly. &ldquo;Just as
we came in sight of the pass, we had to turn and go
back to the base. What&rsquo;s wrong here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a bit,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston replied. &ldquo;We have
two men on our hands&mdash;both badly hurt. We ought to
get them to a hospital without delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the seaplane had been anchored so that a
wayward wind would not dash it against rocks, the
group went into serious conference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>The pilot, Dave Fallouby, was confident he could
get his ship into the air again, if it was not too
heavily loaded. However, he could safely carry only
three passengers. It was decided that Walz, Hansart,
and Mr. Livingston should make the return flight
with him, and that the four Scouts with Craig Warner
would go back to Elks Creek afoot by easy
stages.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the two injured men were carried
by stretcher and propped with blankets as comfortably
as possible in the plane. Mr. Livingston was
the last to climb aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll rendezvous at the Elks Creek Hotel,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Take it easy, boys, on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nervously, the four Scouts and Craig Warner
watched as the pilot stepped up the motors. The
lake was small. If Dave failed to gather speed
rapidly, he might crash into the rocks or willows.</p>
<p>With a mighty roar, the seaplane ploughed
through the waves. Its pontoons lifted slightly, only
to drop again into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too heavily loaded!&rdquo; Willie groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave will make it,&rdquo; Warner said confidently.</p>
<p>A moment later the plane cleared the water. It
skimmed along barely above the lake for a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb&mdash;climb!&rdquo; Jack muttered, his fists clenched.</p>
<p>The plane cleared the rocks at the far end of the
lake. Everyone took a deep, relieved breath.</p>
<p>Twice the ship circled after attaining safe altitude.
Mr. Livingston waved to reassure the Scouts that all
was well. Then the plane headed over the blue
mountains and soon was lost in the distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="h2line1">Chapter 25</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">RENDEZVOUS</span></h2>
<p>Jack sprawled on the hotel bed, munching an
apple. The Elks Creek weekly newspaper was spread
before him, but he had not been reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hap and Craig Warner are an hour overdue,&rdquo;
he complained, looking at his watch. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
they get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they&rsquo;ve been held up at the hospital,&rdquo;
Ken replied calmly. &ldquo;Easy, boy! You&rsquo;ve been fretting
all morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack rolled off the bed. Going restlessly to the
window, he gazed down on the street below. It was
nearly deserted, and there was no sign of either the
Scout leader or the rancher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Hansart is in a bad way,&rdquo; Willie contributed
from the other side of the room. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they
sent for Warner and Hap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Jack acknowledged. &ldquo;I ought to be
patient. It&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;m eager for news.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>Late the previous night, the four Scouts and their
guide had reached the hotel. The long hike over
the mountains had been exhausting, if uneventful.
Nevertheless, even War and Willie had stood the
hard trip surprisingly well. A good night&rsquo;s rest and
a hearty breakfast had revived everyone.</p>
<p>Very early, both Mr. Livingston and Mr. Warner
had been called to the hospital. The Scouts had
received no word from them since their hurried
departure.</p>
<p>To kill time, the Explorers began mapping out the
route they would take on the remainder of the trip
back to Belton City. For the first time since they
had left their homes weeks before, they eagerly
looked forward to returning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Route 52 looks the best to me,&rdquo; Ken said, marking
it with a red pencil. &ldquo;To be sure, though, we&rsquo;ll
have to check at the first Automobile Club office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Footsteps were heard outside the hotel room. Instantly,
the Scouts lost interest in the map. The door
opened, and both Mr. Livingston and Craig Warner
came in. Looking tired, the two men sat down.</p>
<p>The Scout leader said, &ldquo;Joe Hansart is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; Jack repeated sadly.</p>
<p>Mr. Livingston nodded. &ldquo;Pneumonia,&rdquo; he explained
briefly. &ldquo;The doctors did everything possible,
but not even the miracle drugs could save
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he die without recovering his senses?&rdquo; Willie
asked in a low voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Scout leader answered. &ldquo;At the end he
was quite clear in his mind. That was why the
hospital officials sent for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the old man tell you anything?&rdquo; War demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We learned everything,&rdquo; Craig Warner said,
taking up the story. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit fantastic, but understandable
if you know Joe&rsquo;s type as I do. As a very
young man, he chanced upon the Headless Hollow
area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the time Old Stony and your father found
gold there?&rdquo; Jack commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, even as a young man, Joe wasn&rsquo;t right in
his mind. He suffered hallucinations and had obsessions.
To make it short, poor Joe thought that the
valley and the gold belonged to him and that my
father and Stony were intruders. He spied on them
and even shot my father. Then he fled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Hansart himself make that confession?&rdquo; Ken
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I think it&rsquo;s the truth,&rdquo; the rancher
replied. &ldquo;As I said, Joe&rsquo;s mind was clear at the end.
I doubt if Joe ever knew Old Stony was blamed for
my father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the caches of gold?&rdquo; War interposed
eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;Joe found them. He moved the ore to the mouth
of the mine. Over the years, at remote places, he sold
just enough to keep him in supplies. You see, he
thought he had found one of the richest mines in the
state and was afraid word would leak out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he ever file a claim?&rdquo; Ken inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He filed several, but improperly. As soon as we
hit town, I checked on that. I&rsquo;ve filed one of my own
now. Not that it matters much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mine is worthless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not entirely so,&rdquo; the rancher replied. &ldquo;A man
could make a hard living there, perhaps. Only the
hand-picked ore left by Old Stony and my father has
real value. The rest assays too low to make commercial
mining profitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of the ore itself?&rdquo; Jack asked thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it worth anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roughly, I figure it ought to net from $10,000 to
$40,000, depending on transportation costs. Whatever
it tallies, I&rsquo;ll give you boys your share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve already had our share,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston
said with a smile. &ldquo;The gold never interested us as
much as the adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, cash is handy to have,&rdquo; the rancher insisted.
&ldquo;You could use another vacation next year,
couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re always r&rsquo;arin&rsquo; to go!&rdquo; War chuckled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I have luck getting the ore out, I&rsquo;ll send you a
check,&rdquo; Warner promised. &ldquo;Nothing spectacular.
Enough, though, to pay you for your lost equipment&mdash;and
for a vacation next summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do with your share?&rdquo; Jack asked
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay off the mortgage on the ranch,&rdquo; Warner answered.
&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll take care of Hansart&rsquo;s last
expenses at the hospital too, and his funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t bear him any grudge, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jack. He wasn&rsquo;t responsible for his actions.
What a miserable life he had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the one who stole our food at the ghost
town, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Willie speculated.</p>
<p>Warner nodded. &ldquo;Yes, Hansart used that place as
a sort of base for supplies he carried in. He had
caches of canned food and other items stored where
he could dig them up when he wanted them. He
ventured out only when he couldn&rsquo;t avoid it. Even
then, he never in recent years showed up in Elks
Creek. That&rsquo;s why everybody assumed he had died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hansart, of course, was responsible for the area&rsquo;s
bad reputation,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston added. &ldquo;He considered
the valley&mdash;the cabin&mdash;the gold&mdash;everything&mdash;his.
He drove off everyone who ventured that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of Walz?&rdquo; Ken asked presently. &ldquo;Did you
talk to him again?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only briefly,&rdquo; Mr. Livingston returned. &ldquo;He is in
a savage mood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recovering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. He&rsquo;ll be as well as ever, once his leg
mends. Naturally, he denies everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do him no good,&rdquo; Warner interposed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
talked to the sheriff. A guard is being posted at his
hospital room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll be returned to Rocking Horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the state&rsquo;s expense,&rdquo; Warner chuckled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
have to stand trial for manslaughter in the death of
Old Stony. Perhaps he can convince a jury the attack
was unintentional. I seriously doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night, the entire party had a big dinner in
the hotel at Craig Warner&rsquo;s expense. He introduced
them to town officials and many of his friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this keeps on, we&rsquo;ll begin to think we&rsquo;re more
important than a bank president!&rdquo; War protested.
&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll be glad to pull out of here tomorrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Explorers expected to rise at dawn, slip
quietly out of the hotel, and be on their way. Therefore,
it came as a surprise the next morning, when
they found Craig Warner waiting for them beside
their car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice day for traveling,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;Reckon I&rsquo;ll
drive a piece with you, to show you the first fork
in the road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>The rancher drove ahead through the sleepy little
town and into the hills. A blue haze hung over the
distant mountains. A few miles out of Elks Creek,
Warner pulled up, and the Scout automobile drew
alongside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the road to the left,&rdquo; the rancher said, indicating
it with a wave of his hand. &ldquo;The highway is
paved all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gravely he shook hands with Mr. Livingston and
each of the Scouts in turn. Then his eyes roved
toward the high peaks, behind which Headless Hollow
lay hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said casually, &ldquo;I forgot to tell
you. We&rsquo;re changing the name of Crazy Mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Changing it?&rdquo; Jack repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, from now on it will be known hereabouts as
Old Stony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scouts were silent, thinking it over. Jack
turned to gaze toward the faraway mountain top,
magnificent in the colored dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Stony,&rdquo; he said, his voice husky. &ldquo;I like it. So
would he. You know, fellows, that mountain couldn&rsquo;t
have a more appropriate name.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
